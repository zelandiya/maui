# Maui (GPL)

###Summary
Maui automatically identifies main topics in text documents. Depending on the task, topics are tags, keywords, keyphrases, vocabulary terms, descriptors, index terms or titles of Wikipedia articles.

###Demo
You can try out this live [Maui demo](http://maui-indexer.appspot.com/) by just copying and pasting a piece of text of your choice or uploading a document in Word or PDF format.

###Maui performs the following tasks:

* term assignment with a controlled vocabulary (or thesaurus)
* subject indexing
* keyphrase extraction
* terminology extraction
* automatic tagging
* concept extraction

It can also be used for terminology extraction and semi-automatic topic indexing.
