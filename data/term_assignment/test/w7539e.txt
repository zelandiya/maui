<title>Drylands development and combating desertification: Bibliographic study of </title>
<section>1</section>
Preface
It is a well known fact that China has been very active in developing technologies for the rehabilitation of dry lands and combating land degradation and desertification. FAO has been using the Chinese experience especially since the seventies when many visits of experts from developing countries were organized to learn from the country's experience in forestry. The examples have been particularly useful in disseminating technology and illustrating activities for involving communities in plantation, water control work and various approaches to production activities for enhancing food security at local level.
After conducting the same exercise and gaining experience in European countries in transition, the Sub-group on desertification of the former FAO Interdepartmental Working Group on Environment and Sustainable Development has undertaken a new initiative to document experience in land degradation and desertification control in China. The results of this work which was entrusted to the China National Bureau to Combat Desertification, constitute the substance of the present book. It highlights through 148 entries, the major characteristics of the work that has been done in the country in dry land research and development and in Desertification control. Because it is based on a large and diversified range of technologies, the experience of China is relevant to many countries especially developing countries or countries in transition. It is also relevant to cold as well as warm regions. The range of applicability then warrants the efforts that have been spent to collect and
collate the information. The efforts of Professor Ci Longjun, Director General of the China National Bureau to Combat Desertification to coordinate this task and edit the final product are hereby recognized and appreciated.
The Sub-Group on Desertification is indebted to Mr. Jean Paul Lanly who, as chair of that Sub-group, at that moment, did personally put much effort in developing the initiative. It also extends thanks to the China National Secretariat on the Convention to Combat Desertification who helped make the necessary contacts in the development of the document. We thank the authors who have made valuable efforts to identify sources and collect these important and interesting cases. We are sure that this publication will inspire the work of many colleagues and will contribute to the aim of the Sub-group and FAO as a whole, including technology advancement, development and exchange as well as furthering experimentation and practices to combat land degradation and restore food security.

1. Overview of land desertification issues and activities in the people's republic of China
A. The extent of land desertification
B. China's initial achievements in combating desertification
C. Mechanisms for combating desertification
1.1 China is a developing country with a large population and scarce arable land, which feeds 22 percent of the world's population on seven percent of the world's tillable land. China is one of the countries most severely impacted by desertification which encompasses over 30 percent of the total land territory (approximately 3 327 million km^2) and adversely affects 400 million people. Given the scale of the problem and insufficient national financing, combating desertification remains an arduous task. Even with the government's long-standing commitment and numerous successful model projects, land desertification in China is worsening.
A. The extent of land desertification
1.2 Land desertification occurs mainly in the arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas in the western part of northeast China, the north part of northern China and most parts of northwest China. Desertification caused by wind erosion totals 1 533 million km^2 and is distributed in barren and dry grasslands east of the Helan Mountains and Wushiaoling Ridges. It is most serious in the transitional and marginal agriculture and animal husbandry zones of 11 provinces and autonomous regions: Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang and Hebei. Land desertification caused by water erosion totals 1 794 million km^2 and is concentrated on the Loess Plateau (which is the most severely eroded area in China and even the world) and middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Physical, chemical and biological processes of soil degradation and related economic activities are responsible for desertification near oases or other sandy
areas with poor drainage. This is most pronounced in arid regions of the northwest and areas surrounding irrigated oases in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. Climate change, human activities and other factors are accelerating the desertification process along this vast 5 000 km-long arid stretch in northern China. The annual of expansion of land desertification increased from 1 600 km^2 in the 1970s to 2 100 km^2 during the 1980s.
1.3 Ecological degradation and restricted economic development in the affected areas are severe. In the wield-impacted sandy area of northern China the annual number of days of wind greater than force eight is 30 to 100, with sandstorms occurring in some areas. On the Loess Plateau the average erosion model records between 5 000 to 8 000 t/km^2/yr with 20 000 t/km^2/yr as maximum. The annual quantity of silt flowing into the Yellow River now totals 1.6 billion tons (t) which raises the river bed in the lower reaches by ten centimetres (cm) each year. Desertification threatens two million hectare (ha) of farmland and 4.93 million ha of pasture land. Estimated direct economic losses from low and unstable productivity in agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry total 4.5 billion RMB yuan. China's most underdeveloped counties are located in decertified areas.
1.4 The major causes of land desertification in China are climate change and human economic activities. Climate variation and desertification are contributing factors to the phenomena of global climate change. Since the 1970s China's semi-arid and dry sub-humid zones simultaneously experienced increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation. Given current industrial energy usage, China is projected to loose 959 000 km^2 in the humid areas and gain 843 000 km^2 in arid and semi-arid areas by 2030. Sandstorms demonstrate the harmful and destructive impact of climate change. In May 1993 a sandstorm attacked over ten counties in four provinces including Xinjiang and Gansu. Soil loss due to wind erosion was ten to 15 cm, and sand loss, 20 to 150 cm for a total economic damage of 560 million RMB yuan.
1.5 Human activities are a direct cause of land desertification in modern times. Rapid population increases have lead to over utilization of land resources. These include intensification of agriculture and animal husbandry, agricultural reclamation on pasture land, deforestation, overgrazing, destruction of vegetation, misuse of water resources and the lack of environmental protection and scientific management in traffic, mining, energy development, tourism and city building. In the transitional and marginal zones of agriculture and animal husbandry reclamation of sandy land accounts for 25.4 percent of modern decertified areas; overgrazing, 28.3 percent; fuelwood harvesting, 31.1 percent; and other activities. 15 percent.
B. China's initial achievements in combating desertification
1.6 The Chinese government and the Chinese people are pioneers in combating desertification. During previous decades of concentrated work, innovative sand control techniques were developed and significant research results accumulated. Examples include fixation techniques for mobile sand dunes along the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, aero-seeding over shifting sand dunes, narrow strip planting, straw checkerboard networks, windbreaks and shelterbelts of grass, shrubs and trees for farmland protection and agroforestry ecosystems. Integrated management plans for erosion control that include hills, watersheds, ['vests and roads have been developed. The Three-North Afforestation Bureau won UNEP's 1987 Global Environment Protection Award.
1.7 By 1988 plantations established mainly for desertification control covered ten million ha. Forest coverage in northern China rose to 12 percent from seven percent in the 1970s, with ten percent of the decertified land under control. The sheltering effect of these plantations helped open up 1.3 million ha of new farmland; 11 million ha of desert-affected farmland and nine million ha of desertified or degraded grazing land were protected; grain production increased ten to 20 percent and grass fodder production increased 20 percent. During this period degraded forests and grasslands were closed to harvesting or grazing to enable natural rehabilitation to occur. Over eight million ha of fuelwood plantations were established to meet the daily needs of five million local households; wind mills and solar energy were also used as fuel supplements. The result was rapid development of the economy and improved environmental conditions. Erosion was reduced over a 570 000 km^2 area.
Within four years of initiating the National Programme for Combating Desertification, 2 445 million ha had been controlled, including 401 000 ha covered with artificial plantations, 271 000 ha afforested by aero-seeding and 1 47 million ha protected for natural rehabilitation. One hundred thousand ha of seriously decertified land have been converted into farmland.
C. Mechanisms for combating desertification
1.8 Legislation and institutions: Desertification issues are covered under national resource management and conservation laws through the government's promulgation of related legislative acts; examples include the Forest Law Water Law Grassland Law Land Management Law Environment Protection Law and the Family Planning Decree. In 1991 the government formulated policies on Desertification control and rational use of sandy deserts to facilitate enforcement of these laws. The Ministry of Forestry auctioned use rights to sandy wasteland and barren hills for farmers to rehabilitate for private gain.
1.8.1 Combating Desertification is an essential element of the Chinese Government's national economic and social development master plan. The National Desertification Combating Coordinating Group includes representatives from the National Economic Commission Ministry of Forestry Ministry of Water Resources Ministry of Agriculture Chinese Academy of Sciences State Planning Commission Ministry of Finance Ministry of Energy Ministry of Railways and the Poverty Alleviation Office of the State Council. The National Desertification Control Office is located in the Ministry of Forestry in order to coordinate regular programmes and activities; coordination points have been created at different levels of local government. The China National Monitoring Centre for Desertification formed within the same ministry provides information on the changing dynamics of desertification and the results of combating measures.
1.8.2 The Chinese government recognizes that scientific and technological skills to combat Desertification are built over generations and for this purpose has established departments of soil and water conservation and desert control in universities colleges and other national academies. Mid-level professional schools have been set up and educational networks improved; enhanced research institutes and experimental stations serve as focal points for case studies pilot projects and technical extension services.
1.9 Integrated Planning and Management Approaches: Desertified lands in China are vast and varied. At the planning level China integrates the policy. technical and scientific sectors responsible for land resources and Desertification issues giving due consideration to local conditions. An integrated management approach for decertified land water farmland forests and roads promotes the balanced development of agriculture. forestry animal husbandry and water resources. In arid areas affected by wind erosion green shelterbelts are established water resource management improved and activities to protect vegetation and expand oases encouraged. To address wind erosion issues in the semi-arid transitional and marginal ['arming and grazing areas agriculture forestry and animal husbandry are developed in proportion to the carrying capacity of the resource base using techniques such as intensive ['arming tillage systems for dry seasons shelterbelt and fuel forests fodder plantations
and artificial grazing land. In sub-humid areas road planning is incorporated so that industry may contribute to overall development. Integrated small-scale watershed management is applied in areas subject to water erosion. Biological approaches which take advantage of legume. shrub and medicine plants with high economical value are integrated with engineering solutions suitable to the local needs.
1.9.1 Large-scale regional protective forest which are promoted as key national projects to combat Desertification offer additional opportunities for integrated planning and management. These include the Three Northern protective forest system covering forests along the middle and upper reaches of Yangtze River protective forest systems along seacoasts and agroforest systems in plains' areas. The Three Northern Programme crosses 13 provinces and 551 counties in northeast north and northwest China and covers 4 069 million km^2 or 42.4 percent of China's land.
1.10 China's National Action Programme under the Convention to Combat Desertification: China has a strong commitment to implementing the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. A secretariat (China National Bureau to Combat Desertification 18 HePingLi Dongjie Street Beijing 100714; P.R. China Fax: +86 10 6423 4699) and group of senior advisers have been established. The advisory body is composed of 16 academicians and authoritative experts from different disciplines and sectors recommended by the ministries concerned.
1.10.2 A Ten Year National Plan for Combating Desertification (1990-2000) and a National Plan for Water and Soil Conservation (1991-2000) have been prepared based on the Ten Year China National Plan for Economic and Social Development. The Desertification Plan has the following targets:
a. To reclaim 6 66 million ha of decertified land through
- tree/shrub planting and grass growing
- enclosing land for natural revegetation
- aero-seeding of tree and grass seeds
- improving low-yield farmland and pasture
- cultivating cash crops
- maximizing utilization of run-off water
b. To implement 20 greening projects in 20 key counties under nine different Desertification conditions. Each project will demonstrate an integrated approach described above.
c. To increase the percentage of converted decertified land from the present 10 percent to 32 percent by the year 2000.
d. To annually control the negative impact of water erosion on 40 000 km^2 of land.
e. To decrease the farmland areas subject to shifting sand dunes by 25 percent by the year 2000.

2. The natural of arid, semi-arid zones and desertification in the people's republic of China
2.1 Arid semi-arid and dry sub-humid zones cover 2 976 000 km^2 in northern China; extreme arid areas cover 697 000 km^2. This totals 3 673 000 km^2 or 38.3 percent of China's total land mass including 2 080 000 km^2 of decertified land (cf. bibl. entry 26). In Xinjiang province alone there are 423 000 km^2 of desert-China's largest. Gradual invasion of moving sand is decreasing the size of oasis areas (cf. bibl. entry 8).
2.2 Land degradation caused by poor management has long plagued northern China. Desertification-prone land covers 334 000 km^2 176 000 km^2 are already decertified lands and 158 000 km^2 are at risk. From aerial-surveyed topographic maps desertification-prone land increased by 390 000 km' between 1950 and 1970 (cf. bibl. entry 145). The area of degraded land expanded by 1 560 km^2 annually from the end of the 1950s to the mid-1970s and reached 2 100 km^2 in northern China during the last decade. The total area of degraded land approximates 197 000 to 226 000 km^2 Forty-five thousand km^2 of desertification-prone lands were rationally utilized and 2 250 km^2 rehabilitated. (cf. bibl. entries 15 144).
2.3 In the "three-north" region the ratio between greening velocity and desertification velocity is one to eight indicating that rehabilitation of decertified land in China is slow (cf. bibl. entry 111).
2.4 There are 818 000 km^2 of saline land; 173 300 km^2 are threatened with salinisation. To achieve sustainable agriculture in China this vast area of saline land must be improved and utilized (cf. bibl. entry 7).
2.5 China's arid environments have been divided into two types three patterns and 15 zones based on annual aridity coefficients rainfall and accumulated temperature (cf. bibl. entry 106). Regional management strategies and detailed natural resource development utilization and protection measures have been suggested for each area (cf. bibl. entry 1).
2.6 Based upon differences in the desertification process China's decertified lands have been divided into 20 regions' eight showed slight desertification e.g. central plain of northeast China; seven moderate desertification e.g. Bashang in Hebei province; and five severe desertification e.g. northern Shaanxi province (cf. bibl. entry 32).
2.7 Studies on the spatial characteristics of natural disasters divide China into tour Disaster Action territories and 14 Disaster Action regions (cf. bibl. entry 93). Disaster distribution is controlled near the Qingling-Huai He line (34° N). The areas of most frequent disaster action (droughts floods landslides and earthquakes) are located in northern China's Hu line zone. Other disaster centres are Huang He Huai He Hai He the area between Zhengzhou and Wuhan-Dong Ting Lake and the Yunnan-Sichuan-Guangxi border region.
2.8 According to Wu Zheng (cf. bibl. entry 97) desertification patterns and sand deserts in North China have been changing since the glacial activity of the Quaternary period. Between the Quaternary and modern times a sand desert in the broad semi-desert and steppe area of the east part of North China existed intermittently experiencing stable, expansive and retroactive phases. Since 1949 dry climatic conditions, population increases and adverse economic development activities have caused desertification in North China to worsen.
2.9 Trends in desert evolution are determined by climate variation and global climate change. Precipitation in the eastern part of China may increase, thereby alleviating or reversing the desertification process. On the contrary, drought in the western desert region may intensify (cf. bibl. entry 98). If CO' concentrations double and mean annual temperatures increase to 4°C, China's arid zones will expand to 4 630 000 km^2 or 48.3 percent of China's total area, including 2 670 000 km^2 of desertified land. The rate of land desertification will increase to 6 941 km^2 per year (cf. bibl. entry 26).
2.10 Over the past 40 years and particularly during the last decade, China has made great progress in research related to arid zones; certain fields rank among the world's most highly advanced (cf. bibl. entry 130). Topics include:
(a) Inventory and evaluation of land, water, climatic, biological, mineral and other natural resources.
(b) Monitoring and control of natural disasters, including drought, sandstorms and salinisation. It is noteworthy that sandstorm control has been successful.
(c) Evaluation and predictions of geographical and environmental change.
(d) Productivity allocations for industry, agriculture and transportation.
(e) Human population dynamics including national minorities population growth, the population and economy of mountain areas, population and environment relationships and migration.
(f) Regional research and regional development.

3. Definitions and methodologies
A. Definitions
B. Theories and hypotheses
C. Methodologies
D. Studies on the natural environment of arid and semi-arid zones
A. Definitions
3.1 The most widely accepted definition in China for desertification is given by Zhu Zhenda (cf. bibl. entry 145). Zhu describes desertification as the degradation process in environments similar to that of deserts consisting of blown and undulating sand sheets and mobile dunes which occurs when fragile ecosystems such as those with loose sandy surfaces in arid semi-arid and sub-humid zones are exposed to drought and frequent wind. This process reduces biomass productivity and arable land. The environmental changes caused by desertification produce desert-like landscapes in aboriginal non-desert areas or steppes.
3.2 Wu Zheng (cf. bibl. entry 97) has offered another definition: desertification is the environmental formation or development of a sand desert-a deterioration process. A desert is the last or terminal result of the process and reflects a distinct geographical environment. Desertification can occur not only in "unoriginal sand desert areas" hut also in original sand desert areas when sand desert conditions are intensifying.
3.3 During the period 1977 to 1994 the word "desertification" was translated into the Chinese word "sand desertification" (cf. bibl. entry 145).
B. Theories and hypotheses
3.4 Since desertification is an ecological issue studies must address the entire process in a holistic and systematic manner: historical and modern processes physical degradation and rehabilitation. In desertification-prone areas rehabilitation should focus on rational development and adjustment of resource uses; for severely decertified areas supplementary and artificial energy and other material inputs are required (cf. bibl. entry 145).
3.5 Desertification in geological periods was determined by climatic changes a pure or natural process (cf. bibl. entries 32 33 42). In recent times human activities have intensified natural environmental degradation. The development speed of man-made desertification is ten times greater than natural processes (cf. bibl. entries 31 46 97 98 100 144).
3.6 On the basis of feature analysis pattern divisions dating and petrofeature/petrofacies comparisons of paleoeolian sand strata a striate graphical sequence for the desert areas of northern China was developed and the curliness and evolution of desert formations in the early or late Tertiary and Quaternary periods reconstructed (cf. bibl. entry 28).
3.7 During the Neogene period an aeolian sand land formation process existed in the southeastern Tengger Desert that is similar to today's sand transport and accumulation process (cf. bibl. entry 107). The Qinwangchuan basin in Lanzhou consists of' typical aeolian sand eroded from nearby alluvial sand and Malan loess during the last glacial period (cf. bibl. entry 14). A comparative study of the surface texture of quartz sand in inland deserts to that of coastal dunes shows them both to have developed from an aeolian environment (cf. bibl. entry 96).
3.8 In the Taklimakan Desert the instant fluid and impact threshold velocities are 6.05 metres per second (m/s) for naturally mixed sands at a height of two metres (m) above the surface which is equivalent to one minute averages of 5.2 and 4.3 m/s. For ten minute durations fluid and impact average threshold velocities are 5.7 and 4.7 m/s respectively. When fluid and impact thresholds are adjusted for the height of the anemometer tower (11.4 m) the instant velocities are 7.8 and 6.63 m/s respectively equivalent to 7.4 and 5.97 m/s for ten minute durations (cf. bibl. entry 20).
3.9 The black storm over part of Gansu and Ningxia during the late afternoon and early evening of 5 May 1993 was caused by a mesoscale connective system combined with a squall line in advance of a cold front. It moved eastward to consort with a 700-500 hPa mean flow (cf. bibl. entry 49). Using samples collected in Yulin Yan'an Taiyuan Hohhot and Beijing trajectories for a sandstorm that occurred in April 1990 were calculated. During periods of sandstorm activity total suspended particle (TSP) concentrations are several times higher than normal. Aerosols of sandstorms consist mainly of natural lithosphere elements from the earth's crust; their enrichment factors are sharply reduced during sandstorm activity (cf. bibl. entry 108).
3.10 The Basic Theory of Desertification Assessment considers natural and artificial factors influencing desertification historical and recent processes of desertification development trends and ecological and reversing processes. A complete set of assessment criteria and degrees must be established before making an evaluation (cf. bibl. entry 65).
3.10.1 The site classification and evaluation techniques for desert regions in China are adopted from sample studies e.g. the Mu Us Desert region (cf. bibl. entries 12 148) and the shelterbelt systems (cf. bibl. entry 9). The quantitative site evaluation method using multiple shrub species or tree species for desert sites were first applied to site assessments in the Mu Us Desert region (cf. bibl. entry 12).
3.10.2 The aridisoils of Xinjiang form a vast aridisoil zone in central Asia including Kazakstan Uzbecksitan and Turkinenstan. A systematic classification of aridisols in Xinjiang has been revised to include tour newly-recognized sub-orders (cf. bibl.. entry 61).
3.10.3 The climate of the Taklimakan Desert is a complex of basin and desert climates and extreme dry continental climate. Between 1785 and 1986 tour periods can be defined. The general trend was towards a warmer and drier climate (cf. bibl. entry 66).
3.10.4 In the loess area of North China the agricultural landscape is a mosaic of natural and "human-managed" zones that vary in size shape and use. Farmland and forest zones have increased and show a tendency to change shape from simple to complex. The shapes of grassland zones vary at random (cf. bibl. entry 37).
3.10.5 Research on the heat balance of artificial vegetation and bare sand dunes in the Shapotou area showed that in the artificial vegetation regions of the dunes 70 percent of net radiation disperses as latent flux 15 percent as sensible heat flux and 15 percent is stored in the soil. Sixty percent of net radiation disperses as latent heat flux 15 percent as sensible heat flux and 25 percent is stored in the soil in the bare dunes. Water vapour content is higher compared to other dry areas in the Shapotou region (cf. bibl. entry 68).
3.11 A semi-cement medium-fine sand sediment of brown-red colour known as "Old Red Sediment" is intermittently distributed southwards along the coast of South China from Pingtan Island in Fujian province. It belongs to the coastal aeolian deposit formed in the last glacial period of the late Pleistocene. The "Old Red Sandy Sediment" developed in two stages-the coastal aeolian deposition stage and the weathering (oxidization) stage. Time of laterization is no more than 10 000 years (cf. bibl. entry 95).
3.12 Based on analyses of chronological sedimentological geochemical and mineral factors in the lacustrine area of Xiaoshazhi Lake Hobq Sandy Land in Tibet (the highest sandy land in China) did not form during construction of the lacustrine section but after 600 yr.B.P. (cf. bibl. entry 60).
3.13 Future studies of China's shelf sedimentary environment may include the following: (a) the relationship between formation of the great Qinghai-Xizang ice sheet and the Yangtze River delta deposits; (b) the relationship between loess and deserts (loess is always accompanied by deserts); (c) further development of new evidence on desertification of shelf deposits in the last stage of the late Pleistocene (cf. bibl. entry 131).
3.14 By studying the characteristics of grain composition of heavy minerals and surface micro-structure of quartz it can be concluded that Songhua Jiang Nen Jiang Sandy Land came from alluvial sand of Songhua Jiang and the Nen Jiang Plain through wind erosion transportation and deposition. Sandy Land experienced four fixed periods and four shifting periods after formation in the early Holocene (cf. bibl. entry 57). Similar climatic changes have been found in the Hulun Buir Sandy Land since the Holocene (cf. bibl. entry 88).
3.15 Arid and semi-arid land in West China covers one-third of the national land area. Studies on new forms of sustainable natural resource exploitation and utilization are underway to help realize the region's agricultural and forestry potential (cf. bibl. entry 1).
3.15.1 New land use planning techniques can improve desertification control. Land evaluation programs have been completed for Mu Us Sandy Land and Inner Mongolia using the automated land evaluation system (ALES) and geographical information system (GIS) in accordance with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) framework for land evaluation (cf. bibl. entry 25).
3.15.2 Experiments in hilly loess areas of South Ningxia have shown that rotations between grain and bean (i.e. spring pea-spring wheat-spring wheat-broom corn-millet) can adjust maintain and balance soil moisture within the rotation period; alfalfa can be included in grass-crop rotations (cf. bibl. entry 74).
3.15.3 Belt-shaped inter-cropping of sunflower and soybean in arid plains produces remarkable soil and water conservation and economic benefits. Higher yield objectives could be obtained by popularizing improved techniques for saving spreading and utilizing manure (cf. bibl. entry 69).
3.15.4 Agroecosystem components can be readjusted to optimize yields i.e. revising land use ratios between agriculture forestry animal husbandry extending crop varieties and rotation techniques constructing water conservation projects and increasing material inputs such as fertilizer. Using this approach the average grain yield per ha increased by 2 017 kilograms (kg) on semi-arid blowing sand land in northwest Hebei province (cf. bibl. entry 110).
3.15.5 Based on analysis of energy and material flows agroecosystem functions for decertified areas in central Horqin Sandy Land are characterized as follows: the level and amount of energy and material flow are small; energy and material passages are few. It is a low-input low-output. low-benefit agroecosystem (cf. bibl. entry 30).
3.15.6 Desertification is serious in exploited sandy steppe land near coal mines in North China. A number of measures for land conservation have proven to be feasible however and the desertification process has been effectively controlled (cf. bibl. entry 144).
3.15.7 Oases in the arid inland watershed of the mid-West Bank of the Yellow River are high quality agricultural production systems while benefits of oases at the end of the lower reaches are minimal (cf. bibl. entry 122).
3.15.8 It is difficult to eliminate wind and sand disasters in the oases of Xinjiang. Exploiting rich oil and natural gas resources in desert areas and constructing wind power stations in pastoral areas lessens artificial pressures on desert vegetation and of protects desert vegetation in the peripheral areas of oases (cf. bibl. entry 140).
3.15.9 Artificial factors now have a greater impact on the degradation process in the Taklimakan Desert than natural ones. Human activities must be revised and adjusted to help remake the natural environment rather that destroy it (cf. bibl. entry 46).
3.16 Site classification and evaluation systems for shelterbelts have been established for sandy land in semi-arid steppes. Shelterbelt networks on rangeland help increase the amount of warm moist wind and solar radiation; grass yield and quality were both increased. Sand fixation forests help stabilize flowing sand and reduce sand-bearing amounts in the wind. Plant and animal populations improved in extended forest protection areas (cf. bibl. entry 9).
3.17 Wind shelterbelts have the following effect: (a) the influence range for different types of hefts extends four times the height of the windbreak (H) vertically and 50 H horizontally. The distance where wield speed reductions are still at least 20 percent occurs 18.5 H beyond the belts with permeability of 35 percent; (b) the ratio of the average gap between tree crowns to the average height of the belt is an important index for expressing the effect of belts on air flow and permeability (cf. bibl. entry 138); (c) in grazing forests of Inner Mongolia wind speed within the forest was reduced as the closeness of the forest increased. As compared with open wild area evaporation was reduced by 12 to 20 percent while transpiration increased by approximately seven percent (cf. bibl. entry 143).
C. Methodologies
3.18 Remote sensing methods have been used to monitor changes in desertification-prone land in China (cf. bibl. entry 145) land degradation in neighboring areas between Shanxi. Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia (cf. bibl. entry 125) soil erosion in Inner Mongolia (cf. bibl. entry 11) and land resource systems in the shelter forest region of the Dongbei Plain (cf. bibl. entry l 15).
3.19 Hourly satellite data (GMS-4-VISSR Imagery) and conventional data were used to study causes of the black storm formation over parts of Gansu and Ningxia on 5 May 1993 (cf. bibl. entry 49).
3.20 Feature analysis pattern division dating and petrofeature/petrofacies comparisons of the paleoeolian sand strata have been used as the basis for studying the formation and evolution of deserts in China (cf. bibl. entry 28) such as: Southeastern Tengger Desert in Xinjiang (cf. bibl. entry 107) the Hunshandake Desert in Inner Mongolia (cf. bibl. entry 33) the Xiaoshazhi Lake in Tibet (cf. bibl. entry 60) the Taklimakan Desert in Xinjiang and Horqin Sandy Land in Inner Mongolia (cf. bibl. entries 79 100) the Qinwangchuan basin in Lanzhou (cf. bibl. entry 14) the "Old Red Sandy Sediment" along the coast of South China (cf. bibl. entry 95) and the Bakikun Lake in northern Xinjiang (cf. bibl. entry 42).
3.21 Thermoluminescene 14C dating and archaeology analysis show that Songnen Sandy Land experienced four fixed periods and four shifting periods after formation in the early Holocene (cf. bibl. entry 57). The results of spore pollen analysis and 14C dating indicate that Hulun Buir Sandy Land experienced four fixed periods and four mobile periods since the Holocen (cf. bibl. entry 88). The northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau experienced four periods of humid-warm and dry-cold climatic change based on magnetic susceptibility curves lithological characteristics of stratum and other palaeo-climatic indicators (cf. bibl. entry 81).
3.22 A geographic information system (GIS) factorial analysis and statistical methods were used to examine the spatial patterns of agricultural landscapes in the loess area of China (cf. bibl. entry 37). Site classification and evaluation methods have been established for the shelterbelt systems including forest site zones regions sub-regions groups types and plant communities for the semi-arid steppes of sandy land (cf. bibl. entry 9). Comprehensive evaluations of site quality of Mu Us Sandy Land have been made by developing a multiple regression mathematical model which provides a simple method for evaluating the shrub biomass in forest lands (cf. bibl. entry 148). Land resource evaluation of the desert steppe area of Ningxi has been made according to land suitability classifications for farming forestry and animal husbandry (cf. bibl. entry 127).
3.23 The development of desertification can be divided into degrees by an established system of assessment criteria which includes percentage of decertified land in an area percentage of severely decertified land in an area percentage reductions in productivity mean increasing percentages of decertified land annual expansion percentages of decertified land and annual reduction percentages in productivity. According to the degree of desertification and regional continuity China's desertified lands have been divided into 20 desertification regions (cf. bibl. entry 32).
3.24 Natural landscapes of the Loess Plateau have been changed by severe soil erosion. Processes of man-made accelerated erosion and soil degradation have been analyzed using regional investigation methods. experimental studies in chemical analysis of site samples and studies on the impact of forest vegetation destruction and restoration on soil erosion. In the latter the characteristics of natural erosion under conditions of natural ecological balance were contrasted with man-made accelerated erosion caused by forest vegetation destruction. (cf. bibl. entry 136).
3.25 Mathematical applications are detailed in the following studies:
(a) Regression prediction models have been used to study climatic change tendencies in Spring in the Mu Us Sandy Land (cf. bibl. entry 82) and the relationship between vegetation degeneration and soil salinisation in grasslands of Songhua Jiang and the Nen Jiang Plain (cf. bibl. entry 123).
(b) Principal components analysis was used to study the function of human factors in desertification (cf. bibl. entry 31).
(c) A quantitative mathematical model was used to evaluate site quality of Mu Us Sandy Land (cf. bibl. entry 148).
(d) General mathematical models were used to study human effects on soil erosion and desertification systems (cf. bibl. entry 34).
(e) The geographical information system (GIS) was used to study land use classifications for desertification control in Mu Us Sandy Land Inner Mongolia (cf. bibl. entry 25) and spatial pattern analysis of agricultural landscape in the loess area (cf. bibl. entry 37).
3.26 Physics methodologies and studies include the following titles:
(a) The Intermittent. Stable Distribution and Factual Characteristics for Wind-sand Turbulent Flow (cf. bibl. entry 54).
(b) The Heat Balance of Artificial Vegetation and Bare Sand Dunes in Shapotou Area (cf. bibl. entry 68).
(c) The Formation of Songnen Sandy Land and Changes in the Environment (cf. bibl. entry 57) and A Comparative Study of the Surface Texture of Quartz Sand in Inland Deserts and Coastal Dunes China (cf. bibl. entry 96).
(d) The Numerical Simulation of the Features of the Planetary Boundary Layer of the Oasis and Gobi Desert in the Arid Region (cf. bibl. entry 75).
3.27 Wind tunnel studies are applied in:
(a) The meteorological effect of grazing forest grassland experimental station of Baiyintala region (cf. bibl. entry 143).
(b) A test on the sheltering effect of shelterbelts on wind (cf. bibl. entry 138).
D. Studies on the natural environment of arid and semi-arid zones
3.28 Using annual aridity coefficients rainfall and accumulated temperatures as indexes for the classification of arid climate China is divided into two great types three patterns and 15 zones. Climatic characteristics for each type are available (cf. bibl. entry 106). Additional research on meteorological phenomena includes:
(a) Characteristics of the concentration and size distribution of desert aerosols over Heihe region (cf. bibl. entry 53).
(b) The seasonal climatic environment of desertification in coastal areas of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea (cf. bibl. entry 39).
(c) Numerical simulation of the features of the planetary boundary layer of the oasis and Gobi Desert in the arid region (cf. bibl. entry 75).
(d) Heat balance of artificial vegetation and bare sand dunes in Shapotou area (cf. bibl. entry 68).
(e) Sandstorm events in northwest China (cf. bibl. entries 24 49 108).
(f) Wind and sand disasters in Xinjiang including threshold velocities for sand-driving wind in Taklimakan Desert desertification disasters and control countermeasures in the oases and domination of local landforms to sand dune movement in Altai (cf. bibl. entries 20 84 140).
3.29 North China experienced four periods of humid-warm and dry-cold climatic change. Palaeo-climatic change has been studied by many researchers' e.g. the Sandy Desertification Process of the Hunshandake Sandy Land during the Last 5 000 Years (cf. bibl. entry 33) the Age and Evolution of the Taklimakan Desert (cf. bibl. entry 79) Climatic Change in the Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau during the Last 130 000 Years (cf. bibl. entry 81) the Mechanism of Desertification in Taklimakan Desert in Xinjiang and Horqin Sandy Land in Inner Mongolia (cf. bibl. entry 100) and Late Tertiary Aeolian Sand Accumulation and its Environment in the Southeastern Marginal Tengger Desert (cf. bibl. entry 107).
3.30 Present status and future trends of desertification in northern China are widely studied. Decertified lands in northern China expanded slightly over the past 30 years. Some studies show that under the impact of global climate change China's arid zones will expand and become warmer and drier (cf. bibl. entry 26). Precipitation in the eastern part of China may increase and thereby help alleviate or reverse desertification. Drought in the western desert areas may be intensified which will promote the further development of desertification (cf. bibl. entry 98). Other studies on climatic trends are as follows:
(a) Effect of Global Climatic Warming on Erosion and Sediment Yield on the Loess Plateau Shaanxi (cf. bibl. entry 51).
(b) Climatic Characteristics and their Tendencies on the Taklimakan Desert (cf. bibl. entry 66).
(c) Research on Recent Climatic Change in Spring in the Mu Us Sandy Land (cf. bibl. entry 82).
3.31 Oases processes desertification and land degradation are affected by geomorphology. Representative studies include: Oases Processes and Desertification of the Yarkant River and Kagar River Valley S. Xinjiang (cf. bibl. entry 27) the Domination of Local Landforms to Sand Dune Movement Altai, Xinjiang (cf. bibl. entry 84) Desertification of Shiquanhe River Broad Valley in West Qing Zang Plateau (cf. bibl. entry 102) and Land Degradation in the Neighboring Areas between Shanxi Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia Using Remote Sensing Methods (cf. bibl. entry 125).
3.32 Soil water is a key factor in plant growth in arid sand dune areas. It is important to understand the relationships between plants and soil water.
3.32.1 Although the quantity of condensed water in dune fields in Shapotou region is limited it can nourish native plants cryptograms and microbes in addition to improving the biochemical characteristics of sand-fixing plants (cf. bibl. entry 23).
3.32.2 Annual soil moisture dynamics can be divided into four periods in arid plains i.e. intensive consuming period in late spring and early summer resuming and replenishing period during the rainfall season slow consuming period in late autumn and relatively stable period in winter and early spring (cf. bibl. entry 69).
3.32.3 According to the Soil Moisture Balance of Farmland under Different Rotation Systems in Loess Hilly Areas of South Ningxia study soil moisture in layers of one metre is sufficient for planting drought resistance crops (millet) after alfalfa has been grow for five to six years. The soil moisture in layers of' two metres can he replenished after drought-resistance crops have been planted for two to three years (cf. bibl. entry 74).
3.32.4 The study on the Dynamic Variations of Soil Moisture Caused by Rainwater Infiltration in Bare Sandy Land in Shapotou Area of the Tengger Desert notes that the infiltration speed of rainwater is low due to the existence of' a dry sand layer. The redistribution of plays a key role in the dynamic variation of soil moisture (cf. bibl. entry 76).
3.33 Human factors in the desertification process have been studied in tour typical areas in Xijingzi Naritu, Baiyintala and Jiangjia Ravine. Human factors account for 60 percent of the degradation while natural factors account for 40 percent. The difference in speed between natural and man-made desertification processes is significant; the development speed of man-made desertification processes is ten times as great as that of natural processes (cf. bibl. entry 31).
3.34 Quantitative analysis of the effect of human activity can be an important index for analyzing the causes of soil erosion and desertification and provides a scientific basis for soil and water conservation and desertification control (cf. bibl. entry 34).
3.35 There are 90 families 570 genera and 1 693 species of plants in the desert areas and sandylands in North China (cf. bibl. entry 71).
(a) Nitrogen fixation plant resources in the arid regions of Xinjiang have been studied with special reference to legume species and algae (cf. bibl. entries 41, 141).
(b) The sand-fixing plants, Salix flavida, Caragana microphylla, and Hedysarum mongolicum, on sandy soil have been studied (cf. bibl. entries 48, 91).
3.36 Plant-water systems are the focus of considerable research (cf. bibl. entries 23, 47, 63, 74 137).
3.37 Plant nutrients and productivity: Constructive species of the Alex Desert are Chenopodiaceae, Zygophyllaceae, Compositae, Rosaceae. Tamaticaceae and Grarnineae All forage species are greatly deficient in Mo except for grass forages. Forages of the Tribulus family, Leguminosae and Chenopodiaceae are Ca-rich and Gramineous forages are Ca-poor; all contain a medium level of nitrogen. As a whole, plant species of Zygoghyllaceae have a higher enrichment ability to Ca, N and Zn; plant species of Compositae have a higher enrichment ability to Cu. Zn and Mn; plant species of Rosaceae have a higher enrichment ability to Fe Cu. Mn and Co (cf. bibl. entry 38).
3.37.1 The biomass of nine shrub species, such as Caragana intermediate, C. korshinskii. Hedysarum scoparium, H. laeve, Salix psammophila, Amorpha firuticosa, Hippophae rhamnoides, Artemisias phaerocephala, A. ordosica, in the Mu Us Desert have been evaluated. The crown, breadth and height of shrubs reflect biomass yields above ground. Multiple regression mathematical models can be established which provide a simple method for evaluating shrub biomass in forest land (cf. bibl. entries 38, 148).
3.38 Plant succession: From early Holocene to late Holocene the paleo-botanical succession series in Hulun Buir Sandy Land were sub-desert steppe-Artemisia, steppe-sparse forest, stepe-Chenopodioceae and weed steppe. All of these vegetation types belong to the grasslands with sandy soil. The existing sandy grassland should be protected in accordance with the succession laws of ancient vegetation (cf. bibl. entry 88).
3.39 Microbiology: In southwestern Horqin Sandy Land the microbial population, such as bacteria, actinomyces and fungi as well as their physiological groups in afforested sand dunes, are larger than those in shifting sand. The number of bacteria and fungi in afforested sand dunes is two to 16 times higher than those in shifting sand. Generally, the older afforested sand dunes have more bacteria and fungi as compared to newly afforested sand dunes; the microbial numbers are higher in upper layers than in sub-soil layers. In newly afforested sand dunes the actinomyces are higher than in shifting sand, while in the older afforested sand dunes the actinomyces number less than in newly afforested sand dunes (cf. bibl. entry 22).
3.40 Fenced enclosures to exclude grazing animals have been established in oases and desert fringe areas in Xinjiang and Gansu provinces. Vegetation cover and grass yield in the closed pastures increased by 15 percent to 17 percent and 20 percent to 100 percent, respectively after two to three years. Experiments showed that rational utilization of closed pasture could help maintain the ecological balance of desert regions and facilitate animal husbandry development in northern China (cf. bibl. entry 116). A computerized decision-making system for steppe rangelands has been proposed which includes monitoring and assessment (cf. bibl. entry 64).

4. Desertification phenomena
A. Distribution of desertification phenomena
B. Views on the desertification process
C. Desertification caused by natural factors
D. Desertification caused by artificial factors
4.1 Publications with desertification issues have identified the occurrence of various desertification phenomena in different geographical areas of China. These are deflation and mobilization of aeolian dunes, sandstorms or duststorms, soil erosion, degradation of grazing land and cropping land and salinisation (cf. bibl. entry 26).
A. Distribution of desertification phenomena
4.2 The formation, deflation and mobilization of dunes under dry and windy climatic conditions are common desertification phenomena in arid areas. Wind erosion occurs easily and frequently on the loose, surface layer with limited or no vegetation coverage. Wind erosion causes severe deflation through loss of top soil and sand cover on grazing and cultivated land. This phenomena can be widely seen in the desert areas of the northwestern provinces, such as Xindiang, Gansu, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia of bibl. entries 8, 33, 46, 79, 98, 140).
4.3 The sandstorm or duststorm is one of the most catastrophic phenomenon to occur in northwest China. The sandstorm that occurred between 1400 to 2000 on 5 May 1993 in the desert areas of Gansu province had a dust cloud height of 300 to 400 m, frontal dust cloud mean velocity of 50 to 80 km/hr and in stannous wind speed of 20 m/s, causing great damage to industrial and agricultural production in the Hexi Corridor of the province (cf. bibl. entry 133). Catastrophic sandstorm events occur in the arid areas with varying degrees of intensity (cf. bibl. entries 24, 90, 133).
4.4 Soil erosion is wide spread in upland areas of arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions. Many publications which deal with desertification issues on the Loess Plateau discuss soil erosion under the influence of both climate change and human activities. It is estimated that 80 percent of the total 623.7 million ha plateau area is eroded (cf. bibl. entries 51, 63, 81, 125, 136). Soil erosion closely related to desertification is discussed for the Tibet Plateau and coastal regions (cf. bibl. entries 19, 39, 102, 125, 146).
4.5 Degradation of grazing land and cropping land from inappropriate vegetation and land resource utilization is generally expressed in terms of lost productivity, rather than direct observation in the field, since overgrazing and over cultivation usually lead to gradual desertification, particularly near oases (cf. bibl. entries 19, 27, 64, 78, 88, 125, 129, 140).
4.6 Soil salinisation commonly occurs in interior river basins, coastal areas and irrigated areas in arid, semi-arid or dry sub-humid regions. Land salinisation processes can be seen where water conditions are changing from moist to drier (cf. bibl. entries 39, 46, 123, 125).
B. Views on the desertification process
4.7 The formation and development of deserts in both geological and modern times is discussed in many publications. There is general agreement that the desertification process started and expanded following the change from a cold-humid climate to a warm-dry climate during the late Tertiary or early Quaternary periods. Various geological, geochemical and lithological methods used to study the geological ages of different desert areas in China indicate that desertification coincided with global climatic change, although estimates as to when desertification started in northwest China vary widely: early Tertiary, late Tertiary to early Pleistocene, late Pleistocene and early Holocene (cf. bibl. entries 14, 28, 42, 57, 60, 79. 100, 107, 122, 123, 127).
4.8 In comparison to the gradual and slow desertification process in geological periods, seasonal or periodic dry climates alternating with humid conditions over a period of ten years or longer, are responsible for relatively drastic and rapid desertification in some regions, such as the coastal areas of Yellow and Bohai Seas (cf. bibl. entries 39, 43, 127).
4.9 Numerous publications deal with the issue of acceleration of natural desertification processes in the modern period due to human activities (cf. bibl. entries 21, 27. 31. 43. 46, 51, 64. 78, 94, 98, 100, 102, 123, 125, 129. 136, 146). The greenhouse effect created by modern industrialization and urbanization also contributes to desertification (cf. bibl. entries 26. 98).
4.10 The literature attributes desertification to two factors (cf. bibl. entries 26, 31, 98). Natural or climatic factors include climatic change in geological periods and climatic variation or periodical alternations in the modern period. Artificial or biological factors include negative influences of human activities on the natural environment, such as over cultivation, overgrazing, large-scale irrigation of farmland, overcutting of fuelwood and overuse of water resource. Although natural factors were originally responsible for desertification, artificial factors now speed up the progress under certain dry and windy climatic conditions (cf. bibl. entries 26, 31, 98).
C. Desertification caused by natural factors
4.11 Many studies address the development of desert areas or aeolian landforms in the geological period. The aeolian sand landform process existed in the late Tertiary period in the Tengger Desert when the climate was dry and hot of bibl. entry 107): it has been proven that the modern desert environment started during the early Tertiary and continued into the Quaternary to form the Taklimakan Desert (cf. bibl. entry 79). The northwest desert areas, Mu Us Sandy Land, Loess Plateau, Tibet Plateau, formed during the Tertiary and Quaternary: climate change was the dominate factor (cf. bibl. entries 19, 28, 57, 60, 64, 79, 100. 107, 358).
4.12 Periodical climate variations from humid to dry and windy, as well as seasonal change in coastal climates, promote regional desertification. In the Mu Us Sandy Land region, the climate changed periodically from drier to wetter over the last 40 years, i.e. wetter in 1960s, drier in 1970s, wetter in 1980s and now drier in 1990s (cf bibl. entry 82). In coastal areas of the Yellow and Bohai Seas, a dry climate combined with strong winds in winter and spring has caused seasonal desertification (cf. bibl. entry 39).
D. Desertification caused by artificial factors
4.14 Population increases and associated human activities in regions with arid, semi-arid or dry sub-humid climate put pressure on natural ecosystems. This exploitation of natural resources, including the natural vegetation resources and land and water resources, causes serious soil erosion that has lead to desertification of these regions.
4.15 Overgrazing on the steppe is a wide spread problem in rural areas of north China. The quality of plant species, vegetation coverage and community structure of the grasslands are greatly reduced; grassland steppe is more vulnerable to conversion into desert, steppe or hare land (cf. bibl. entries 19, 27, 64, 125, 129).
4.16 Over cultivation and loss of original irrigation conditions on farmland due to insufficient water supply encourages land salinisation or desertification in areas with a dry and windy climate. Strong winds and water shortages cause farmland to be decertified and converted into desert, even in oases (cf. bibl. entries 27, 125, 140).
4.17 Overcutting of fuelwood from natural woodlands has caused serious destruction of vegetation and soil erosion in the upland areas of the arid or semi-arid regions. Extensive over cultivation of woodland or grassland has led to soil erosion or desertification of the cultivated area (cf. bibl. entries 110, 102, 140).

5. Combating desertification and drylands development in the people's republic of China
A. Socio-economic aspects of combating desertification
B. Economical measures costs and profitability
C. Techniques and technologies of drylands development and combating desertification
D. Scientific research related to drylands development and combating desertification
A. Socio-economic aspects of combating desertification
5.1 In the Yutian oasis of the Keyiya River basin, people recognize that intensive agriculture development and unreasonable human activities can produce unfavourable changes in the environment, particularly in the lower reaches of the river. The whole river valley must be viewed as a management unit. Rational utilization and development of water resources are the foundation for creating a stable ecological environment. It is both necessary and feasible to set up a natural protective zone to ensure an adequate water supply, for example, 100 to, 150 million m^3 of water storage in Daheyan oasis (cf. bibl. entry 17).
5.2 A case study of the Shiquanhe River valley suggests that desertification control and ecological restoration measures should include both protecting existing vegetation and establishing artificial vegetation in the valley (cf. bibl. entry 58).
5.3 Zone differences must be taken into consideration when applying basic principles of systematic engineering to the rehabilitation of decertified land.(cf. bibl. entry 117). Such practices were adopted in dry land farming areas in semi-arid regions in southern Ningxia and in southwest Songhua Jiang and the Nen Jiang Plain (cf. bibl. entry 78).
5.4 A proposed dynamic monitoring system for duststorm area environments, one of China's most serious forms of natural disaster in arid and semi-arid regions, will consist of gale alarming, image processing and mapping, a database analysis model, disaster evaluation model, disaster prevention policy-making model and an alarm information transmission system (cf. bibl. entry 90).
B. Economical measures costs and profitability
5.5 Economic results achieved during a decade-long trial for revegetating a large-scale shelterbelt system on desert sandy lands at the Desert Experimental Center of the Chinese Academy of Forestry were as follows: the economic income of the desert sandy land increased from 4.29 yuan/ha/year in 1979 to 1359.28 yuan/ha/year in 1989 and could justify use of a loan at below 9.7 percent annual interest rate (cf. bibl. entry 1).
5.6 Upon completion of the Jartal Salt Lake Project in Jartal Salt Lake region of Ulan Buh Desert in Inner Mongolia, wind velocity near the ground surface was reduced by 13.3 percent to 13.7 percent. Sand volume transported into the lake was reduced to 367 000 m^3 per year from 1 275 000 m^3 per year.
C. Techniques and technologies of drylands development and combating desertification
5.7 Poplar tree growth, soil moisture and heat and groundwater levels were observed at regular intervals between 1984 and 1990 under different conditions of artificial water supply. The results showed that irrigating artificial plantations of Populus (popular Chon-lin) in the dry regions of northwest China could raise the groundwater level within the plantation growth period 0.5 m to 1.54 m and that soil moisture and temperature could be effectively improved (cf. bibl. entry l 14).
5.8 Successful measures to exploit sandy land for agricultural and animal husbandry development include intensive management by planting trees and afforestation (cf. bibl. entry 48). A study conducted in the eroded tideland hilly areas, located in Pengang county of the South Ningxia, developed a cropping system for dry land farming which focused on the grass-animal husbandry-nutrient-grain relationship. Comprehensive measures were designed to promote drought resistance and preserve soil moisture; new varieties of crops and optimal systems of cultivation and tillage were introduced (cf. bibl. entry 83).
5.9 Restoration of degraded steppe rangeland demonstrated that rhizomatic grass rehabilitated more quickly than tussock grass; the restoration process was of a monostable state; restoration dynamics corresponded generally to spatial changes along, a grazing gradient. The main steppe rangeland communities dominated by Stipa gobina, S. breviflora. S. krylovii, S. grandis, S. baicalensis and Aneurolepidium chineses will converge into a Artemisia frigida community under sustained grazing influences. It is a fine forage species and an important species for resisting steppe degradation. Grazing retrogression in steppes was divided into two successive stages: rangeland utilization (improvement) and degradation. The area of desertification was divided into desertified and latent desertification on the reclaimed steppe in marginal areas (cf. bibl. entry 145).
5.10 To resist drought, cold and damage from salinisation, fallow seeding with concentrated fertilizer is a traditional farming practice in northern winter wheat areas of China.
5.11 A variety of measures, including biological measures (planting trees and grasses), mechanical measures (sand fences) and combinations of both were adopted to fix shifting sand in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu province (cf. bibl. entry 13). Key techniques to raise tree survival rates and control desertification are: enclosing sand land for plant growing and artificial broadcast sowing, laying mechanical barriers, selecting appropriate tree and shrub species, employing "front shelter and back pull" techniques to fix shifting sand and matching tree density to ensure sustainable use of water resouces (cf. bibl. entry 52). In Hulun Buir grassland in northeastern Inner Mongolia, techniques such as drilling and straw checkerboard wind breaks are used to fix mobile sandy land along with a combination of shrubs and grasses. Shrubs can be used to make biological windbreaks; grasses can protect the surface from wind erosion (cf. bibl. entry 35).
5.12 In Horqin a study based on succession series of psammophytes in sandy land showed that the model for establishing artificial vegetation should consist of a landscape of sparse wood grassland, with shrubs as a main species and trees as a secondary species. Inter-dune depressions with a water table higher than four to five metes are suitable for planting Pinus sylvestris var. mongoloca, windward slopes of sand dunes for Artemisia halodendron and Caragana microphylla and leeward slopes for Salix gardejevii.
5.13 According to tests conducted in the Chengcheng, Qianxian and Wugong counties of Shanxi province, stubble mulching is important for maintaining and improving soil water content, soil structure and fertility; crop yields increased by ten percent to 20 percent. Using 6 000 kg/ha of wheat straw as stubble mulching, the moisture stored in 200 cm of soil can store 41.9 milimetres (mm) of rainfall water more than in land without mulching at the end of summer fallow (cf. bibl. entry 99). Tests with wheat straw mulching in fruit orchards such as grape, hawthorn, peach and pear on newly created sandy land in Yucheng county of Shangdong province showed that mulching could adjust soil temperature, avoid high temperature harm to fruit trees in summer, ensure their safety over winter, improve water and nutrient conditions, suppress weed growth and lessen sand drift damages for better growth and development of fruit trees and higher yields (cf. bibl. entry 126).
5.14 Plastic sheet covers for crop cultivation can effectively overcome natural constraints and prolong the use of light, heat, water and fertilizer in the arid and semi-arid areas. Tests in Pengyang county of Ningxia showed that corn yields increased by 70 percent with plastic sheet covers (cf. bibl. entry 104). In Xinjiang the practice of irrigating over pored plastic film saved 30 to 50 percent of the irrigation water and offered a yield increase of over ten percent compared with furrow irrigation. (cf. bibl. entry 35).
5.15 Tillage techniques are essential for water storage and soil conservation in arid plains. Intercropping of sunflower and soybean in belt shapes produces benefits for soil and water conservation and good economic returns (cf. bibl. entry 69). The technique of mulch seeding with no tillage for summer corn has been extended to include three field operations (wheat harvesting with straw chopping and spreading, direct seeding and fertilizing and weed control with herbicide spraying) and six farming techniques (seed treatment, mulching, direct seeding, granulated compound fertilizer, application, herbicide spraying and insect control). A lighter, less costly mulch seeder (2BQM-6D) was also developed.
5.15.1 Considering the principle of water equilibrium and the law of runoff movement, land preparation can effect rainfall distribution and thereby adjust soil moisture. During tests in the semi-arid loess hill and gully area of North Shaanxi, annual water collected from rainfall was 29.22 kg, 33.95 kg and 37.85 kg at 1.5 m x 2 m, 2 m x 2 m, and 2.5 m x 2 m, respectively.
5.15.2 The reverse-slope terrace form of land preparation collected the largest amount of rainfall at 26.5 mm, followed by contour trench at 24.8 mm and fish scale pit at 20.7 mm (cf. bibl. entry 86).
5.15.3 Between 1979 and 1988, grasses were air-sown on 267 000 ha in Mu Us Sandy Land, Horqin sand land and on the eastern fringe of Tengger Desert. One hundred and eighty-one thousand ha of decertified and degraded pasture lands were regenerated. Sand surfaces were kept in a semi-fixed condition by proper grazing to prevent serious degeneration due to crust formation (cf. bibl. entry 105). The conserving effect of aerial seeds, Hedysarum mongolica Turcz, H. scoparium Fisch et Mey, and H. mongolica was tested on moving sand dune chains in the Yulin area of the Mu Us Desert. The vegetation belt of Hedysarum mongolica widened from 24 m to 35 m due to germination of the sub-terranous stem. The survival rate increased from 17.7 percent to more than 60 percent. Aerial seeding, is a good method to control dunes, particularly in an isolated area (cf. bibl. entry 139).
5.16 Sand control systems have been adopted for use along railway lines in the Gobi and other deserts according to sand damage conditions. The Shapotou section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway line includes enclosed belts, upright fences on the front side of sand dunes. straw checkerboard barriers and irrigated forest belts along both sides of the railway. In the Shixiazi section of Ganwu Railway where there is no water for irrigation the sand control system consists entirely of straw checkerboard barriers along both sides of the line (cf. bibl. entry 103).
5.17 In oases and desert fringes of Xinjiang and Gansu provinces, 67 000 ha of closed pasture were fenced to exclude grazing animals. After two to three years the vegetation cover and grass yield in the closed fields increased by 15 to 17 percent and 20 to 100 percent, respectively (cf. bibl. entry 116). In Naiman Banner of Inner Mongolia nine plant communities existed prior to pastures being closed to livestock grazing. After several years the vegetation coverage and community types increased and shifting sand stabilized. The biomass in to enclosures increased rapidly during the first three years: it continued to increase during the next five years, but at a slower rate (cf. bibl. entry 121).
5.18 Xingride Farm, in the southeastern Qaidam Basin, is a test site for methods to transform and improve the desert ecosystems of the Qinghai-Xijiang (Tibet) Plateau into viable agricultural systems. Although there are sufficient water sources and intense solar radiation, the climate is cold, arid and windy and soil fertility low. Water irrigation and wind-break shelterbelt systems with a forestry coverage of l 3 percent were established, resulting in micro-climatic and soil fertility improvements. Crop yields have gradually become higher and more stable; animal husbandry and profitable woodlands have been developed (cf. bibl. entry 147).
5.19 According to a project proposal for desertification control in the central "One-River-Two-Tributaries" basin in Tibet, 84 600 ha of decertified land in the region will come under control during the 1990s. The comprehensive index of economic, ecological and social benefits is expected to rise by 33 percent during the project period (cf. bibl. entry 62).
5.20 In the Shapotou area on the southeastern fringe of the Tengger Desert, where the annual rainfall is approximately 186 mm, artificial protection methods are practiced using dune vegetation stabilization as a main measure and mechanical dune stabilization as an auxiliary measure. Over a 30-year period soil improved and mobile sand dunes were fixed (cf. bibl. entry 119).
D. Scientific research related to drylands development and combating desertification
5.21 Constructive species of the Alxa Desert are Chenopodioceae, Zygophyllaceae, Compositae, Rosaceae, Tamaticaceae and Gramineae with a coverage of one to 20 percent according to an analysis of macro-elements and trace elements of 44 forage species in nine families. All forage species are greatly deficient in Mo, except for Gramineous forages. Forages of the Tribulus family, Leguminosae and Chenopodiaceae are Ca-rich and Gramineous forages are Ca-poor; all of them contain a medium level of nitrogen. As a whole plant species of Zygoghyllaceae have a higher enrichment ability to Ca, N and Zn; plant species of Compositae have a higher enrichment ability to Cu. Zn and Mn; plant species of Rosaceae have a higher enrichment to Fe Cu. Mn and Co (cf. bibl. entry 38).
5.21.1 Resistance to NaCl, Na[2]SO[4], NaHCO[3], Na[2]CO[3] in seven Tamarisks were quantitatively studied using the PCA method and can be ranked in the following order: Tamarix laxa> T kansuensis> T. elongata> T. hohenackeri > T. austromongolica > T. arceutholdes > T. ramosissima (cf. bibl. entry 124).
5.21.2 In the northeast semi-arid regions ecological benefits are expressed in terms of evaporation rates (cf. bibl. entry 45). The shelterbelt effect helps reduce monthly field evaporation during the growing season by a maximum of 30 to 32.5 mm and 13.8 mm on the average (cf. bibl. entry 45).
5.22 In Horqin the succession series of psammophytes in the sandy land are Agriophyllum spuarrosum, Salix gordejevii, Artemisia holodendron, perennial herbs (Agropyron cristatum), shrubs (Ephedra sinica, Pranus sibirica) and trees (sparse Ulmus pumila grassland) (cf. bibl. entry 56).
5.22.1 The annual litter fall in 25 to 27 year-old Mongolian Scotch pine and Chinese pine plantations is 2.5 to 3.0 t/ha and 3.0 t/ha, respectively, and 2.4 t/ha in 22-year old Simon poplar plantations. The soil humus content was as much as 7.5 to 9.6 and 2.4 to 11.1 times greater in A1 and A2 layers as in the same layers of mobile dunes. The humicacid-fulicacid ratio declined and tended to stabilize. C/N value was raised and the amount of soil microbes in different stands distinctly increased (cf. bibl. entry 50). Some sand-fixing plants, such as Dalix flavida Chang et Skv, Caragana microphylla Lam and Hedysarum mongolicum Turcz, can effectively stop sand movement. Wind velocity within the plantation was greatly reduced so that soil erosion lessened and litter accumulated on the ground under the plants, benefiting all soil characteristics (cf. bibl. entry 91).
5.23 Research in the Naimen area in northeast China revealed that the desertification process affects various elements of the near-surface micro-climate first. This causes extreme loss of solar radiation-up to 572 w/m², including 50 percent of net radiation at noon. Daily mean reflectivity is 36 percent; air and ground temperatures show great variation. The reduction of surface roughness and intensification of turbulent motion causes wind erosion, resulting in greater deterioration and desertification (cf. bibl. entry 44).
5.23.1 Based on five years of research on a large-scale, shelterbelt system at the Desert Experimental Center of the Chinese Academy of Forestry, the micro-climate effects were: Angstrom turgidity coefficient reduced by 35 to 40 percent; amount of falling dust decreased by 40 percent; absorption of short-wave radiation increased by ten to 20 percent; amount of shifting sand reduced by 80 to 90 percent; the original structure of the sand drift altered (cf. bibl. entry 10). A new index Xi (the ratio of the average gap between tree crowns to the average height of the belt) was proposed for evaluating the effect of shelterbelts. This is useful for planning and designing shelterbelts and evaluating their effectiveness (cf. bibl. entry 88). The influence range of different types of belts extends 4 H in the vertical range and 50 H in the horizontal range. The distance where wind speed reductions are still at least 20 percent occurs 18.5 H behind belts with permeability of 35
percent (cf. bibl. entry 138).
5.23.2 At the grassland experiment station in the Beiyintala region, wind speed was decreased significantly with forest coverage on artificial grassland stands. In open grasslands, the relative wind speed was 64 percent, 60 percent and 45 percent and with forestry coverage, three percent, six percent and 25 percent, respectively. Evaporation was reduced by 12 to 20 percent while transpiration was increased by 7.3 percent (cf. bibl. entry 138). Tests of a tree-shrub landholding forest in Northern Linze Oasis showed that after eight years of afforestation, sand dunes had been stabilized, wind reduced by 50 percent and relative air humidity increased by 68 percent thus decreasing evaporation potential by 43 to 60 percent. After 12 years forests can provide 39 tons of firewood charcoal and 51 tons of litter fall per ha (cf. bibl. entry 138).
5.24 After 35 years of testing sand-fixing plants on moving sand dunes in Shapotou area, general principles for species selection were developed. Exotic species must be introduced from temperate sandylands and be able to withstand a temperature lower than -25C, whereas domestic species must be introduced from sandylands in semi-desert and desert zones with a rainfall of less than 300 mm. Both pioneer and mid-stage plants in the successional processes should be considered for planting on either windward or leeward slopes of moving sand dunes; species must be carefully selected. Species can produce flowers and seeds with a high survival rate, i.e. above 70 percent and show rapid growth and persistent sand-fixing functions for several years or longer (above 10) (cf. bibl. entry 72).
5.25 In the sandy area of Shapotou, 12 species of Caragena Fabr. were tested for structural characteristics of leaf and water physiology. Their order for drought resistance from high to low us: C. leucopholea, C. acanthophylla, C. tibetica, C. Stenopylla, C. korshinskii, C. opulens, C. hololeuca, C. intermedia, C. microphylla, C. roborovskyi, C. erinacea, C. arborescens (cf. bibl. entry 126). According to tests on abandoned sandy farmland in Bashang region, plant species have different responses depending on soil types, soil moisture conditions and habitats. The best species for this area were Arena saliva, Vicia Sativa and several species of Phalaris genus (cf. bibl. entry 134). In Xinjiang 373 strains of rhizobia which belong to 31 genera were separated from 109 species; 88 strains were rhizobia from updated reported nodules of plants. Ninety-five percent of the nodules formed by these rhizobia were efficient in nitrogen fixation. Nitrogenous activities remained in all of
the nodules. Nodules from Astragalus genus plants possessed high nitrogen fixation capacity, the maximum of which was 42 times more than soybean nodules in the same locality. Uptake hydrogenous activity in nodules was detected in 97 percent of 37 species from 20 genera. Both nitrogenous and hydrogenous activities are closely related to the growth of plants (cf. bibl. entry 50).
5.26 Based on analysis of complex indices covering growth, physiology and anatomy. Aborvitae and Chinese pine prove to be good drought resistance species, followed by Mongolian Oak and purple blow maple. Black locust is poor in comparison. Among shrub species, common smoke tree, common seabuckthorn and little leaf peashrub are relatively drought-resistant species compared to shrubby labseindigo (cf. bibl. entry 137). The concept of water potential compensation point of net photosynthesis rate (Pn=O) was used to evaluate drought tolerance. This is an important indicator for identification and selection of genetic variation in drought tolerance for tree clones. Six poplar clones were treated with PEG (mW 6000) solution at three drought tolerant levels (-0.4 Mpa, -1.0 Mpa, -1.6 Mpa); their water potential compensation point was studied, and the clones were further divided into two groups by their ability to resist drought (cf. bibl. entry 67).
5.27 Poplar clones from high latitudes of Europe and America were introduced in North China; four clones of P. euramericana and one clone of P. deltoides were selected based On disease and cold resistance tests and productivity. In six-year old poplar stands of selected clones, the height is 14.5 m to 16.8 m; average DBH, 19.5 cm to 22.9 cm; average volume per tree, 0.1956 to 0.3126; and form figure of the stem, 0.4476 to 0.4650. The volume of selected clones increased by 46.3 to 134.2 percent compared to the control cultivator, P. beijingensis (cf. bibl. entry 132). Poplar density effected tree growth, stand structure and economic return. In Jianping county of Liaoling province, testing suggested that 4 m x 4 m and 4 m x 6 m were suitable for developing middle-diameter timber with the rotation of ten to 12 years and 5 m x 6 m was suitable for developing large-diameter timer with the rotation of 12 to 15 years (cf. bibl. entry 114).
5.28 In general, trees can be planted in areas with precipitation of over 350 mm. Artificial stands were successfully established under non irrigated conditions in the Shapotou area at the southeastern margin of Tengger Desert where annual precipitation is less then 180 mm. During the initial stage of afforestation, moisture content of sand dunes varied from two to four percent, eight years later it was reduced to one to two percent, and 20 years later to 0.59 to one percent.

Classification:
6Cb
Region:
Xinjiang, China
Summary:
Large areas of farmland protection forests near oases are critical links in oasis protection systems and are essential measures for farmland protection in desertification-prone areas. Afforestation techniques using narrow belts and small nets were first adopted in Xinjiang. They have now been widely applied and have proven successful in promoting desert agriculture and animal husbandry development. The narrow forestbelt is usually four to eight trees wide and loosely structured with a wind-through coefficient of 0.3 under force four wind (on the Beaufort scale). This has an effective protection range equal to 23 times tree height; wind speed is reduced by 40-47 percent on the average within the effective protection range. There are two types of protection forestbelts: high or low density. If the shelterbelt has the wind-through coefficient of 0.75, the effective protection range is 11.1 times tree height and wind speed can be reduced by 22 percent on the average within the
effective protection range. The size of the shelterbelt net should take into consideration irrigation, cultivation, field management and farmland protection requirements. Shelterbelt systems with higher densities or shorter distances between shelterbelts has been widely applied in northern China. In order to raise the efficiency of land and water utilization, forestbelts, consisting of' three to four lines of trees are usually established in combination with drainage canal construction and roads. In areas of severe sand flow, shelterbelts should cover a net area of' ten to 13 ha, with a distance between two major belts of 100 to 200 meters and be built against the dominant wind direction. This protection forest model of "narrow belt and small net" has been effective in improving sand flow and climatic conditions.

Summary:
Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is the major transportation route that connects northwestern and North China. In the Shapotou area of Zhong Wei county, Ningxia Autonomous Region, the railway passes for 55 km through the Tenggei Desert, where large net-shaped or semilunar moving sand dunes are prevalent. Average annual precipitation is 185.6 mm; dry local climate and moving sand dunes threaten the safety of railway transportation through the area. To help guarantee safe passage. sand control plans and operating designs were developed, which included both mechanical and biological methods such as building up sand-binding grasses in blocks of 1 m x 1 m to reduce the wind speed and flow of sand, engineering approaches to sand fixation and sand retardation and forest belts. Based on 30 years of field research and practice, comprehensive sand control systems along railways are now well established and ensure safe railway transportation. Between 1958 and 1986 over 202.61 million tons of
goods and 22.16 million people traveled safely by railway through Shapotou area.

Summary:
This study develops a site classification system and evaluation method for forest site zones, regions, sub-regions. types, groups and plant communities in semi-arid steppe sandyland. Based on productivity measurements qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted; the same site was used to evaluate different tree species and different sites were used to evaluate the same tree species. Comprehensive indexes are proposed to evaluate the technical and economic characters of protected forests: (1) effective value of warm and moist wind occupancy in shelterbelt networks on farmland, (2) daily and seasonal rate of photosynthesis, respiration and transpiration of crops, increments of organic mater and vitamin content in crop seeds, (3) improvements in the physical and chemical characters of soil. Improvements from shelterbelt networks on rangeland included increased occurrences of warm and moist wind and solar radiation, as well as improved grass yields and quality. Sand
fixation forests can improve the ecological environment by fixing flowing sand and reducing the amount of sand-bearing wind. Improved plant and animal populations in protection forest areas led to social. economic and ecological benefits. Benefit assessment indices which integrated both economic and technical aspects were developed for protected forest areas.

Summary:
Based on the structure, function and succession mechanisms of desertificated rangeland in arid or semi- arid regions, field trials to establish shelterbelts were conducted on cattle rangeland (6 400 ha.) in the Keerqing Sandy Land area of Balinyou county between 1971 and 1984. A comprehensive land use plan was developed to promote utilization of rangeland resources while maintaining a stable and balanced ecosystem. Low-yielding desertificated rangeland was improved through high diversity of plant species, increased community hierarchies and high forage biomass. Seventy-nine shelterbelts, totaling 60 km in length, were established to cross each other, thereby forming 77 nets. Thirty-three ha of "umbrella forest" (a shaded place for livestock in summer) and 100 ha of sand-fixation shrub vegetation were included in the protection system One thousand one hundred ha of different types of forests were established as shelterbelts; plant cover increased from less than one percent to
16.8 percent for 3 300 ha of rangeland and grass above-ground biomass increased by 417 kg/ha or 21.67 percent. Forage quality was increased by 53.3 percent and the mean height of grass, 109.59 percent. This shelterbelt rangeland model has been applied to 313 000 ha of rangeland on which 16 700 ha of shelterbelts forests have been constructed.

Summary:
Agriculture and animal husbandry in the Hexi corridor of Gansu province are threatened by 3.07 million ha of sandy desert. A variety of measures, including biological measures (planting trees and grasses), mechanical measure (sand fences) and a combination of these measures have been used to fix shifting sand. Sand-fixing measures can be divided into functional types: primary and secondary. The former includes sand fixation and sand block methods; the latter, increasing soil organic matter, fine particles and nutrients. The former can be expressed by an erosion-deposition coefficient, whereas the latter can be expressed by the contents of organic matter and N as well as the percentage of sand particles finer than 0.1 mm. The cost of different sand-fixing measures are calculated in order to guide selection.

Summary:
Shelterbelt development in semi-desert and desert zones is closely related to the climatic condition; therefore, annual precipitation levels are important to consider in shelterbelt design. It is generally accepted that areas with precipitation of 350 to 400 mm or more are suitable for planting trees, 300 to 350 mm for shrubs and 200 to 250 mm for drought resistant shrubs. Two hundred millimetres of precipitation is the lower limit for afforestation. Chinese scientists have successfully established artificial vegetation under non irrigated conditions in Shapotou area at the southeastern margin of Tengger Desert, where the annual precipitation is less than 180 mm. Observation data showed that during the initial stages the moisture content of afforested sand dunes varied between two and four percent; eight years later the figure was reduced to between one and two percent; 20 years later, 0.59 to one percent. Artificial vegetation was entirely replaced by natural vegetation.

Journal of Desert Research. 10(3)
Date:
Language:
Chinese
Classification:
2B, 6Da
Region:
North China
Summary:
Water is an important environmental resource for in hyper-arid zones. During historical periods the natural desertification process in Keyiya River valley reduced water supplies; oases became deserts. Changes in modern desert environments are caused mainly by human economic activities. Two examples are given. One is expansion of desertification in the Yutian oasis due to agricultural development and the another is human disturbance to the natural oasis in the lower reaches of the Keyiya River. Rational utilization and development of water resources can serve as a foundation for a stable ecological environment if the river valley is managed as a territorial unit. Daheyan oasis is a landscape zone with special significance for exploring environmental change and plant succession in arid zones. A natural protective zone has been established to ensure 0.1 to 0.15 billion m^3 of water. Development of Yutian oasis and establishment of a protective zone are mutually supportive.
Economic and environmental benefits can only be achieved if land and water resources of the valley and related agricultural activity are managed as part of an ecological unit.

Summary:
The lower reaches of the Heihe River, also known as the Ejina River, were known as the Ruoshui River in ancient times. In recent years land desertification in this area has developed rapidly due to increasing water consumption in the upper reaches and a subsequent reduction in water supply to the lower reaches. Gaxun Lake at the eastern end of the river dried up in 1961 and the groundwater table along the river dropped by 0.5 to 3 m due to a decreasing recharge rate. Plant species along the river banks, such as Phragmites communis and Populus euphratica, died. Swamp and meadow soil on river banks turned into salinised soil (e.g. an evolution pattern of swamp soil-saline meadow soil-meadow salty soil-mineral salty soil) Irrational land use, soil moisture deterioration, wind erosion and land sandification increased and dust storms intensified. Given water's importance to desertification control, there is an urgent need to develop a water distribution plan for the entire basin.

Summary:
Using Gongkahan Township as an example. this paper addresses the land desertification issues in the western Ordos area of Inner Mongolia. This agropastoral region is situated in the transitional zone between steppe and desert with a fragile ecological environment. Mean annual rainfall is 275 to 288.5 mm, mean annual temperature is 6.3 to 5.6 °C. Land desertification is characterized by strong water and wind erosion; the former is prevalent in the western mountainous region while the latter is dominant on the middle and eastern plateau. According to severity, decertified lands in the area can be divided into slight, medium, severe and very severe. Main measures to combat desertification include eliminating cultivation to restore pasture, closing off sandyland so that grass can grow, practicing anti-deflation tillage, protecting existing vegetation and developing irrigated agriculture.

Summary:
Sand-driven wind is an important factor in aeolian sand movement. Proper sand control measures depend on accurate threshold velocities for estimating sand transport rates. On the basis of field observations, this paper attempts to determine fluid and impact thresholds and adapt them to different heights and time durations so that wind data obtained from meteorological observatories can be more efficiently used to study sand movement. At two metres above ground for naturally mixed sands, the instant fluid and impact threshold velocities are six to five m/s, equivalent to one minute averages of 5.2 and 4.3 m/s. Averages for ten minute durations are: fluid and impact threshold velocities of 5.7 and 4.7 m/s, respectively. Both fluid and impact thresholds have been adjusted for the height of an anemometer tower (l 1.4 m) at which the instant velocities for the former and later are 7. 8 and 6.63 m/s respectively, equivalent to 7.4 and 5.97 m/s for ten minute averages.

Summary:
The middle eastern part of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is located in the transitional zone between warm steppe and desert steppe on the Loess Plateau. Under the influence of a dry and windy climate, loose sandy surface and improper human economic activities, the area has become one of the most seriously decertified region in Ningxia. Although the succession stage of decertified steppe vegetation is difficult to judge, this report successfully distinguishes vegetation into two groups and four phases using cluster analytical methods. The vegetation succession of decertified steppe is different from those of sandyland vegetation and abandoned field vegetation. Cynanchum komarovii and Peganum nigellastum are indicator plants in the beginning and developmental phases of decertified steppe vegetation succession. The key issue in converting disertified vegetation into steppe vegetation is control of human activities.

Summary:
Hygroscopically condensed water, created through molecular hygroscopic and thermodynamic processes, is an important aspect of the relationship between plant growth and water balance in arid sand dune areas. During autumn nights in Shapotou area the maximum depth affected by condensed water varied from seven to nine centimetres. As a rule water condenses in the night and releases in the daytime. Micro-climatic factors, such as wind speed, temperature and relative humidity, affect both the hygroscopic condensation and the amount of condensed water. Although the quantity of condensed water in dune fields is limited, it can nourish the native plants, cryptograms and microbes and improve the biochemical characteristics of sand-fixing plants.

Summary:
China has only seven percent of the world's cultivated land of the world, but feeds 22 percent of the world's population. Therefore land is of critical importance to China. According to Chinese government information (28 August 1991), the population in China increases by 16 million per year, while cultivated land decreases by 4 600 ha due to water and soil erosion, desertification and nonuse of agricultural land. Decertified land occupies 13.4 percent of China's total area and is increasing every year. Land use and land degradation issues are of critical concern to China. Mu Us Sandy Land is a typical, seriously decertified land area. Different types of sand land are scattered over 77 percent of the total sandyland area. Population growth and environmental degradation are increasing the need to find new solutions and approaches to the desertification problem. Control of land desertification can only be achieved by changing land use planning methods. Land evaluation is a
systematic way of assessing land use suitability from which plans can be developed to control human misuse of lands. In this volume land suitability analyses are based on the automated land evaluation system (ALES) and geographical information system (GIS) methodologies. The authors obtained data from investigations of 3 810 field survey plots, l 200 soil profiles and 604 tree trunk analyses; there are ten (GIS) maps. The computerized methods are in conformity with the FAO's framework for Mu Us Sandy Land evaluation.

The impact of global change on desertification in China
Publisher:
Journal Of Natural Resources. 9(4): 289-303
Date:
Language:
Chinese
Classification:
2B, 3D, 4Aa
Region:

Summary:
This article discuss the impact of global climate change on desertification in China based on predictions of increasing CO[2] concentrations (which could double by the year 2030) and mean annual temperatures if current industrial patterns remain unchanged. The analysis adopts UNEP's aridity index (ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) which ranges from 0.05 to 0.65, excluding arctic and sub-arctic regions. The potential evapotranspiration is obtained from Thornthwaite's formula. Research results are based on 30 years of data from more than 700 meteorological stations in China. (1) Under the impact of global change, China's arid zones will expand and land desertification will develop. Currently, China's arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas cover 2.976 million km^2, plus extreme arid areas of 697 000 km^2. Total size of arid and extreme arid areas is 3.673 million km^2 or 38.3 percent of China's total land mass, including 2.08 million km^2 of
desertificated land area. After CO[2] concentrations double and mean annual temperatures increase by 4 °C, China's arid area will expand to 4.63 million km or 48.3 percent of China's total area. including 2.67 million km^2 of desertification land. The increasing rate of land desertification will be 6 941 km^2/year. (2) Under the impact of global change, China's arid zone will become warmer and drier. According to data gathered over 40 years from more than 160 meteorological stations in China, during 1951-1991, the ten-year running mean temperature of arid (semi arid and dry sub-humid) areas has shown a tendency to increase since the 70s. Ten-year running precipitation data also increased since the 70s, but more slowly. The annual mean temperature of China's arid areas increased insignificantly; winter temperatures increased but summer temperature deceased. The annual precipitation in arid areas increased prominently after the 70s. In semi-arid areas temperature increased
since the 70s, especially in winter; precipitation decreased as compared to the 50s and 60s.

Summary:
Drainage areas of the Yarkant and Kagar Rivers are major regions of agricultural production in the southern part of Xinjiang. Typical arid desert climate, geologic structures and geomorphic features predominate. In oasis areas two interrelated processes occur simultaneously, i.e. destruction of the desert ecosystem and establishment of artificial oases. In the interior of an oasis, the ecosystem is becoming more stable; on the frontier of an oasis, exploration and exploitive utilization of oasis resources have caused ecological degradation and desertification. Desertification in troth river systems is characterized by the following phenomenon. (1) Mobile sand and desert are expanding because of water shortages in farmland areas and simultaneously strong winds. (2) Natural vegetation had been damaged due to lack of water or overcutting of fuelwood. (3) Grassland degradation is the result of overgrazing and digging Licorice. (4) Sand is accumulating on both sides of irrigation
channels or in ditches. Before 1974, the Yarkant River recharged the Tarim River throughout the year; after 1979, the Yarkant River no longer recharged. With increased human activities lack of water has became so severe that hydrographic structures have changed. Poplar trees covering large areas have died. Environmental degradation of the desert is advancing at such a pace that inhabitants are migrating.

Summary:
Furrow seeding with applied fertilizer to resist drought, cold and injury from salinisation and to improve wheat responses to fertilizer is a traditional agricultural practice in parts of northern winter growing areas of China. Mechanized 2BFG-6(S) fertilizing and furrow seeding implements for grains now intensify the process. This is beneficial in dry and humid years. A production increase of 14.7-20 percent can be expected. A 2BFG-6(S) furrow seeder combined with a 8.8-11 Kilowatt tour-wheeled tractor for use at the Weibei Rainfed Highland (an area of low productivity and salinisation) fulfilled the essential agricultural requirements for furrow seeding of grains and intensive fertilization.

Summary:
This paper examines how local agroecosystems function, using Baiyintala village as an example. Baiyintala is situated in the central Horqin Sandy Land which experiences an annual rainfall of 362.3 mm, annual evaporation of 1 935 mm, and annual mean wind velocity of 3.4 m/s, with a maximum of 18.7 m/s. Baiyintala's agroecosystem consists of five subsystems, i.e. farrowland, forestland, grassland, and inhabitant and livestock areas. Total area is 4 944 ha of which farmland occupies 2737.3 ha, forestland of 2 472 ha and grassland, 33 360 ha. Energy inputs for the agroecosystem include solar, industrial, biological and man and animal power. Energy outputs include biological energy, grain, oil and animal products. Material inputs are precipitation, chemical fertilizer and manure. Based on analyses of energy and material flows, agroecosystem functions in decertified areas can be characterized as follows: scale and amount of energy flow and material flow are small and energy and
material passages are few. It is a low-input, low-output, low-benefit agroecosystem.

Summary:
The areas of Xijingzi, Naritu, Baiyintala and Jiangjia Ravine are to study human factors in the desertification process, applying qualitative and quantitative methods developed by other experts. Comparative analysis of desertification criteria and quantitative studies of recent desertification processes show that the influences of human factors on desertification are comprehensive and dominant. In historical periods desertification was determined by natural factors, especially climate change. Dry climate changed the environment into desert, including large areas of shifting dunes. An unstable society and economy developed. In recent times, desertification is caused by human activities, particularly population increases and livestock pressure. Although recent desertification is largely a man-made process, natural processes are still at work. In Naritu human factors account for 60 percent of the desertification process while natural factors account for 40 percent. The
development speed of man-made desertification is about ten times greater than natural processes.

Summary:
Based on regional differences in desertification development processes, the authors establish criteria for assessing degrees of desertification. Their system includes six criteria: percentage of decertified land in an area, percentage of severely decertified lane in an area, productivity reduction percentages, mean increasing percentage of decertified land, annual percentage of expanding decertified land and annual percentage of productivity reduction. Degrees of desertification are slight, moderate and severe. According to degree and regional continuity, China's decertified lands can be divided into 20 regions. Eight have slight desertification (such as the central plain of northeast China), seven have moderate desertification (such as Bashang in Hebei province) and five have severe desertification (such as northern Shaanxi province). This research provides a foundation for developing distinct plans to combat desertification.

Summary:
Concepts differ on the origin and development of sandy desertification in the historical periods. This paper uses a comparative method based on climatic variations and stratum profiles to study the historical processes of sandy desertification. The analytical results based on climatic variations in historical periods show that dry and humid phases alternated. The Yaoshitu profile in Hongshandake includes three layers of dark sandy soil and three layers of yellow aeolian sand, which indicate that Hunshandake Sandy Land experienced three stages of stabilized dunes and mobilized aeolian sand, respectively. The area is presently in the third (during the last 5 000 years) mobilizing aeolian sand stage. Historical processes of sandy desertification in the Hongshandake Sandy Land were primarily due to climate change.

Summary:
The sandy steppe of Hulun Buir Grassland is situated in the northeastern part of Inner Mongolia. Total area is three million ha. Experimental studies were carried out on a sand belt in the dry steppe zone with a dry climate, minimal rainfall, open vegetation and a mobile sand field. Soils are fixed sand and semi-fixed sand. Protophytes have been heavily damaged by human beings and overgrazing creating uncovered surfaces and wind erosion that seriously threatens people's livelihood. In order to fix mobile sand, big-technical methods such as drilling and straw checkerboard wind-breaks are employed on mobile sandyland. A combination of shrubs and grasses can be used for establishing biological windbreaks; grasses can protect the surface from wind erosion. Over five years vegetation coverage increases were calculated as 0 to ten percent to 25 percent to 85 percent; soil fertility also improved.

Summary:
Yuchen county in Shandong province lies in the semi-humid zone where stabilized and semi-stabilized sand dunes exist. Sand grain size varies between 0.05-2 mm. In order to study features of the dry sand layer of sandyland four plots were selected at the top of mobile dunes. The tour plots, 2 m x 2 m in area, include: bare mobile sand land, irrigated bare sand land, irrigated peanut field and irrigated grassland. A series of observations and analyses were conducted in September when sunshine intensity is lower and time shorter. Results suggest that daily changes in dry sand layer thickness in semi-humid sandyland coincide periodically with daily soil temperature and air temperature changes. Thickness development velocity of dry sand layers covered with vegetation is slow; on the contrary, the thickness development velocity of bare sand layers is fast. The development velocity of the dry sand layer in crop fields is faster than in grassland. The moisture under dry sand layers
changes slowly with air moisture when dry sand reach seven to eight centimetres.

Summary:
Agricultural landscape is a mosaic of' natural and human activities arranged in a variety of patterns and on a variety of scales. The spatial quality of' the landscape can influence ecological phenomena and is a critical component in understanding ecological dynamics. Geographic Information System (GIS), fractal analysis and statistical methods were used to examine the spatial patterns of agricultural landscape in the loess area of China. A land use map on a scale of 1:10 000 was digitized to cover ten land use categories: irrigated farmland, check-dam farmland, terrace farmland, slope farmland, orchard, grassland, bush, forest, reservoir and residential land. The size and fractal dimension of patches, patch elongation index, diversity, dominance, relative richness and the fragmentation index of landscape of gullies were calculated using models and the GIS. Along with the increases in "human-managed" patches the shape of farmland and forest patches tend to change from simple
to complex. The shape of grassland patches vary at random. The authors suggest planting buffers between hill tops and hill slopes and between hill and gully slopes to control soil erosion and improve landscape connectivity.

Date: 1994
Language: Chinese
Classification:
2Ea, 2Eb, 3Ac, 4Ba, 4Bb, 4Bc
Region:
Eastern China
Summary:
The coastal climate of the Yellow and Bohai Seas is controlled by the East Asia continental air mass during winter and spring and the West Pacific oceanic air mass. The former helps create an arid and windy decertified environment with rare precipitation, low air humidity, high daily temperature differences, high aridity and frequent strong winds. The climatic conditions in winter and spring of the coastal areas of the Bohai are similar to those of the inland desert of northern China. In coastal areas of the Yellow Sea, strong winds are frequent and the climate is very dry in winter, making the area desertification-prone. During summer and autumn precipitation is quite sufficient and wind infrequent and weak, making the climate favourable for plant growth. Coastal areas of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea are therefore subject to seasonal desertification.

Summary:
This book presents research conducted during the last decade on nitrogen fixation plant resources in the arid regions in Xinjiang The biological character of the legume species with root nodules and associated nitrogen fixation nodule bacteria species, nodule bacteria populations and their physiological and biochemical reactions and stress resistant capacities and the effectiveness of nodule bacteria application in arid areas is systematically discussed. Special attention is given to land-distributed nitrogen fixation algae species, distribution patterns in arid regions in Xinjiang, ecological conditions, population characteristics, physiological functions and application potential. Valuable germplasm resources of plant species that possess the root nodules were firstly identified. Of the 20 000 legume species in the world, 3 000 possess nitrogen fixation root nodules; 85 percent of these have not yet been systematically studied. Even in areas such as Xinjiang, which
possesses large areas of desertificated or saline land, nitrogen fixation plant resources adapt to the arid environment.

Summary:
This paper uses sedimentary profiles, i.e. representative Hole A combined with age-determination data, to systematically study various environmental elements of Balikun Lake in northern Xinjiang. The sedimentary environment provides indicators of biological, physical and chemical processes in arid land, which confirm that environmental change of Balikun Lake evolved during a period of alternating cold-wet and warm-dry climates. This inland-type climate has been influenced by environmental change factors since the late period of late Pleistocene. Given the region's special geographic position, studies of these phenomenon provide a model for inland-type climates and support other regional studies in global climate change.

Region:
Loess Plateau, Shaanxi
Summary:
In order to find effective measures for storing water and conserving moisture, experiments in stubble mulching have been conducted in Chengcheng, Qianxian and Wugong counties, Shaanxi province since 1984. Three years of experimental results show that when the land to be planted with winter wheat is covered with wheat straw during the growth period, soil water contents increase remarkably and water is maintained in the upper layer of soil. Land mulched with 6 000 kg of wheat straw per ha was the most effective. Moisture stored in the 200-cm soil layer can store 41.9 mm of rainfall water more than in the land without mulching at the end of summer fallow. Stubble mulching also improves soil structure and fertility. Wheat yield in mulched land may increase ten to 20 percent in comparison with nonmulched land, justifying extended use of stubble mulching.

Region:
Inner Mongolia
Summary:
Situated in northeastern China, Naiman area has a temperate grassland monsoon climate. Under the influence of drought and strong wind, decertified land in the area has expanded to 5 720 km^2 seriously affecting economic development. Preliminary micro-climate observations on the sandyland showed that when desertification processes intensity the near-surface micro-climate is affected first. Solar radiation loss is up to 572 w/m2; net radiation averages 50 percent at noon. Daily mean reflectivity is 36 percent. Air and ground temperatures also show great variation. There is a reduction in surface roughness and an increase in turbulent motion causing wind erosion on the land surface. These climatic elements directly reflect deterioration of the desertification environment.

Summary:
The ecological benefits of shelterbelt networks are attributable to their integrated effects on various meteorological factor. The calculated regression equation is: Ec = 246.52 - 12.17e + 0.58t + 6.58u. Monthly field evaporation during the growing season can be reduced by 30 to 32.5 mm which is equal to an additional heavy rainfall. The average monthly reduction is 13.8 mm, equal to a medium rainfall in sheltered farmlands Two-thirds of the total network area receives the most benefit; none or little-benefited areas occupy only four to five percent. Benefits depend on tree height of shelterbelt and size of' the network which can be regulated by proper design.

Classification:

Region:

Summary:
In temperate deserts snow nearest plants melts first, followed by the snow in more distant areas. As a water flow passage into the soil appears, centred at the plant to collect the snow melt and water the plant, the depth of wet sand increases. Data from sampling areas indicates to what extent sand moisture around plants increases. The amount of snow melt collected by the plant's root zone is 56.77 mm, which is 228.9 percent of the snow melt received in barren areas. The utilization efficiency of snow melt for desert plants is improved as moisture moves from upper soil layer to deep soil. This, in turn, influences the distribution pattern of desert plants.

Summary:
This author discusses new ways to develop and utilize sandyland in order to meet population growth needs and use natural resources more efficiently. It is possible to improve sandyland uses, since sandyland areas have rich light and heat resources, peculiar biological resources consisting of more than 1 000 plant species and over 600 animal species. As an ecosystem, sandyland is quite fragile. One desertification control model is presented here-a successful experience exploiting sandyland resource by developing agriculture through planting trees and establishing shelterbelts. Agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry should be developed comprehensively and intensive management techniques applied.

Region:

Summary:
The article reviews the storage, composition and decomposition of litter, the content and components of soil humus and the distribution of soil micro-organisms in sand plantations, based on data acquired between 1980 and 1988. Results show that annual litter fall in 25-27 year-old Mongolian Scotch Pine and Chinese Pine plantations is 2.5-3.0 t/ha and 3.0 t/ha, respectively, and 2.4 t/ha in 22-year-old False Simon Poplar plantations. The content of soil humus, which increases in surface layers of different stands, was 7.5 to 9.6 and 2.4 to 11.1 times higher in A1 and A2 layers as that in the same layers of the mobile dunes. Plantations not only increased the content of organic material but also make the humicacid/fulicacid ratio decline and stabilize and raise C/N values and amounts of soil microbes in different stands. It is preferable to establish mixed plantations with Mongolian pine, broadleaf trees and shrubs which increase the content of soil humus and microbes, thus
changing both composition and quality.

The effect of global climatic warming on erosion and sediment yield on the Loess Plateau
Publisher:
Geographical Research. 12(2):1-8
Date:
Language:
Chinese
Classification:
2B, 3Ab, 4Aa
Region:
Loess Plateau
Summary:
In recent years' erosion and sediment yield on the Loess Plateau have declined due to periodic reduction in precipitation. This paper discusses variations in erosion and sediment yields on the Loess Plateau given future trends in global climatic warming. Based on historical correlations between the variations in erosion and climate, strong erosion and deposition have been shown to occur during dry periods. Global climatic warming will cause the Loess Plateau to become wetter and vegetation cover should increase, leading to a reduction in erosion and sediment yield. Limited environmental carrying capacity and over population, however, will counteract this benefit and cause erosion and sediment yield to remain at present levels.

Summary:
The Ningxia Forestry Department and the Japanese Consultation Association for Overseas Forestry carried out a joint desertification control experiment in 1990 and 1992 at the Gaoshawo Forestry Centre in Yanchi county, Ningxia. The project sought to raise the survival rate of planted trees through enclosed sands for plant growth and artificial broadcast sowing, mechanical barriers, planting shrubs and grasses by hand, variation in tree and shrub species and density and "front shelter and back pull" techniques to fix shifting sand. The landscape has resulted in ecological, economic and social benefits. Vegetation coverage has risen 74 percent. Practical experience in areas such as plant selection and use of absorbent polymer material can have wider application.

Characteristics, concentration and size distribution of desert aerosols over the Heihe region
Publisher:
Plateau Meteorology. 12(2): 170-179
Date:
Language:
Chinese
Classification:
2B, 2Eb
Region:
Gansu, China
Summary:
In the Heihe region the concentration of desert aerosols is usually low; fine particles are predominant. Striking increases in dust concentration can be observed during dust blowing periods, particularly coarse particles (diameter {D} of between 2.0 and 10.0 m) which increase more than 20 times. They account for 9.6 percent of the total number of particles, much higher than on clear days (1.9 percent). Moderate precipitation removal is the most effective for desert particles with D3/4 4.0 | Ìm (90 percent), but is not as effective with all particles, specially to those with D£3/40.4 | Ìm. Therefore desert aerosols with 0.5£1/4D£1/44.0 | Ìm may be transported on long-distances. Movements of large-scale air masses may greatly change the concentration of desert aerosols. The diurnal variation of background desert aerosol is mainly controlled by air dispersion or dilution. There are three sources of background desert aerosols: global background aerosols, large-range background
dust and local soil dust. The measured size distribution of desert aerosols is characterized by three modes, which can be fitted into the sum of three log-normal distribution functions.

Summary:
Based on the heterogeneity and intermittence of wind-sand turbulent flows this report discusses the relationship between percentages of sand and height of flow. The formula M (h>Ho)=Ch^-D is derived from the stable contribution theory. This results in the factual dimension D=2.36 (h > 10 cm), D= 1.465 (h < 10 cm), the velocity distribution w(lul)=921ul-D/2-1 and the sand particle diffusion <l x (t)l > µ t^2/D. According to the travelling solution of the kdv Burgers equation, the scaling law for wind-sand flow v/bx, +Dlnh=A was found; it reveals the inherent relation among the dissipation v, dispersion b wind velocity x, and height h. In addition, the starting radius of sand particles, the starting wind velocity and the multifractal characteristics of wind-sand flow are calculated and discussed.

Summary:
Horqin Sandy Land is a typical sandy soil steppe in northern China which covers 40 000 km^2. Annual precipitation varies between 320 and 460 mm and falls mostly from June to August; moisture content is 0-180 cm and the shifting sand layer ranges from three to tour percent. According to the research of Liu Yingxin, et al. the succession series of psammophytes in sandyland are as follows: Agriophyllum spuarrosum, Salix gordejevii, Artemisia halodendron, Perennial herba, e.g. Agropyron cristatum, shrubs, e.g. Ephedra sinica, Prunus sibirica and trees (sparse Ulmus pumila grassland). Based on the above-mentioned site conditions, model artificial vegetation should include: a landscape of sparse wood grassland with shrubs as main species and trees as secondary species; interdune depressions with a water table higher than four to five meters suitable for planting Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica; windward slopes of sand dunes suitable for Artemisia halodendron, Caragana microphylla
and leeward slopes of sand dunes suitable for Salix gordejevii.

Summary:
The paper studies formation factors of sandyland, characteristics of grains, composition of heavy minerals and the surface micro-structure of quartz. Songnen Sandy Land is believed to have come from the alluvial sand of Songhua Jiang and Nen Jiang Plain through wind erosion, transportation and deposition. There are two or three layers of paleosol in the sandyland. The results of Thermoluminescene, 14C and archaeological analysis indicate that this sandyland experienced tour fixed periods and tour shifting periods after it formed in the early Holocene. Paleo-environments in the west Songhua Jiang and Nen Jiang Plain during the Holocene were reconstructed according to changes in sandyland and pollen characteristics of the paleosol.

Region:
Qing Zang Plateau, China
Summary:
Shiquanhe River at the elevation of 4 250 m is surrounded by mountains which block humid air currents; the climate is dry and cold, with an annual average temperature of -0.2 °C. The frost-tree period is 80-100 days/year and annual average precipitation 73.7 mm. The Shiquanhe River Valley belongs to the sub-alpine desert vegetation and alpine steppe zones. Moor and meadow are distributed on banks of the Shiquanhe River and other seasonal rivers, which are dominated by Kobresia spp and Carex spp., accompanied by Triglochin palustris and Chenopodium glaucum. Abundant species and high yield grasses have made the meadow grasslands a major grazing ground, now heavily overgrazed. In the river valley the shrub meadow, which consisted of Myficatia elegans before the 1960s, has been damaged. Typical xerophytes such as Caragana versicolor, Ceratoides latens and Aiania gracilis grow toward the center of valley where only Myricaria elegans shrubbery grew some years ago, indicating that
the habitat of the valley is becoming arid. Once the vegetation was destroyed, wind erosion action intensified, causing loss of water and soil and desertification. Measures aimed at ecological restoration and desertification control should protect existing vegetation and establish artificial vegetation in the valley.

Summary:
Grazing degradation trajectories for the main steppe rangelands in Inner Mongolia are studied by combining site-specific experiments in typical steppe areas and overall investigation of the total region. The study concludes that: (1) Plant species can indicate both positive and negative, and qualitative and quantitative vegetation changes as a result of grazing. Species which can tolerate moderate grazing pressure are noted. (2) Restoration of degraded steppe rangeland demonstrated that rhizomatic grasses rehabilitate more quickly than tussock grasses. The restoration process was in a monostable state; restoration dynamics corresponded generally to spatial changes along the grazing gradient. (3) The main steppe rangeland communities dominated by Stipa gobina, S. breviflora, S. krylovii, S. grandis. S. baicalensis and Aneurolepidium chinese will converge into Artemisia frigida community under sustained grazing influence. A. frigida is the most effective quantitative indicator
species of grazing pressure. fit is also a fine forage species and an important species for resisting steppe degradation. (4) The concept of steppe degradation is discussed. the difference and relationship between steppe retrogression and rangeland degradation are analyzed. The grazing retrogression of steppes is divided into two succession stages: rangeland utilization (improvement) and degradation. The quantitative criteria for rangeland degradation are established. A computerized system for steppe rangelands decision-making is suggested which includes monitoring and assessment.

Climatic characteristics and trends in the Taklimakan Desert
Publisher:
Journal of Desert Research. 10(2)
Date:
Classification:
2B, 2Cb, 3D, 4Aa
Region:
Xinjiang, China
Language:
Chinese
Summary:
The climate of the Taklimakan Desert is a complex of basin and desert climates and extreme dry continental climate. It is characterized by violent change between cold and heat, minimal but concentrated and highly variable precipitation, frequent winds and severe sandstorms. There has been a trend toward a drier and warmer climate on the southern edge of the desert over the last 200 years. From 1785 to 1986, the average growth temperature for Popular Diversifolia was 19.66°C. From 1960 to 1980, however, the average growth temperature was 20.71 °C, an increase of 1.05 °C. This signifies a trend towards a warmer climate. The curve also indicates that despite small fluctuations, temperature was on the rise. Four periods can be defined: 1785-1848 with growth temperature below average value by 1 °C in 1820; 1848-1907 with a temperature-rising period with the greatest increase of 0.9 °C; 1907-1939 with a drop in temperature having a maximum value of 1.5°C. Although this rise in
temperature has been slowing down, no drop is expected in the next 30 to 40 years. In 75 years from 1790 to 1846, there was abundant rain, i.e. double the average value of 50 mm. During the succeeding 20 years from 1864 to 1883, precipitation levelled. From 1883 to present, it has been at below average levels. The last thirty years have witnessed a decrease in precipitation, 13.59 mm less on the average than in the past. The curve of annual runoff from the Keriya River points to similar conclusions. During 142 years, from 1734 to 1875, annual runoff averages ran above or close to the historical average. From 1875 onwards it has fallen under the average.

Relationship between net photosynthesis and drought tolerance in six poplar clones
Publisher:
Scientia Silvae Sinicae. 30(1):83-87
Date:
Classification:
2Ec, 6Ea
Language:
Chinese
Summary:
In order to test drought tolerance, six poplar clones were treated with PEG (mW 6 000) solution at three osmotic potential levels (-0.4 MPa, -1.0 MPa, -1.6 MPa), and their net photosynthesis rates (Pn) studied in growth culture chambers. The results show that under -1.6 MPa stress Populus simonii, P. poplaris 36 and 44 kept greater photosynthesis product accumulation until the second day. P. nigra, P. eramericane 25/86 and 28/86 decreased consumption levels from the first day. Pn decline under -1.0 MPa stress showed the same trend. Based on the significant difference in Pn of different clones under medium and severe water stress, the concept of water potential compensation point of net photosynthesis rate (Pn = 0) was developed to evaluate drought tolerance. Thus, the six poplar clones can be divided into two types: in the former group the water potential compensation point appears later; the group has a higher ability to tolerate drought. The latter group has a lower
drought tolerance since the water potential compensation point appears earlier. This is important for early identification and selection of genetic variation in drought tolerance for poplar clones.

Discussion of tillage techniques for storing water and conserving soil in arid plains
Publisher:
Bulletin of Soil and Water Conservation. 12(6):64-70
Date:
Language:
Chinese
Classification:
2Eb
Summary:
Location observations of soil moisture at layers varying from zero to 200 cm in depth were made. Soil moisture dynamics during the year in arid plains can be divided into four periods, i. e. intensive consuming period in the late spring and early summer, resuming and replenishing period during the rainfall season, slow consuming period in late autumn and a relatively stable period in winter and early spring. The vertical distribution of soil moisture can be divided into three sections, i.e. quickly changing layer (0-20 cm), brisling layer (20-100 cm) and relative stable layer (100-200 cm). On the basis of these results, tillage techniques for storing water and conserving soil in arid plains were studied. In arid plains, inter-cropping of sunflower and soybean in belt shapes produces remarkable benefits for soil and water conservation and the economy. Popularizing these techniques will result in savings on manure, improved utilization of manure and increased yield.

Anti-desertification strategy and ecological model of a water-saving rice plantation on sandy soil in the inter-lacing agropastoral region
Publisher:
Journal of Desert Research. 15 (spc.1)
Date:
Language:
Chinese
Classification:

Region:
Inner Mongolia, China
Summary:
This paper proposes an anti-desertification strategy and ecological model for high-level reconstruction of' severely destroyed ecosystems and transformation of the micro-landscape. The proposal is based on an analysis of the two major processes of material differentiation in the desertification of inter-lacing agropastoral regions in semi-arid zones: the coarsenation of soil particles on ground surfaces caused by wind erosion and the accumulation of water in inter-dune depressions caused by vegetation destruction. The strategy seeks to fully utilize coarse sandy substrate as a valuable resource and to promote economical use of the accumulated water. Basic techniques of the ecological model for water-saving rice cultivation on sandy land include a layer of plastic film in the sandy soil, suitable rice varieties, water-saving, fertilizer control and zero tillage measures. The plastic film, although only 0.03-0.05 mm in thickness, effectively prevents water and fertilizer from
downward seepage and salts from upward migration. The ecological model not only increases farmland productivity and soil fertility, but also acts as part of a comprehensive and integrated anti-desertification strategy. Series of water-saving rice plantations can be connected to forage cultivation and livestock grazing, forming a sound ecocirculation system to decrease grasslands pressure on large areas of sandy rangeland.

Region:

Summary:
After 35 years of experience with sand-fixing plants on moving sand dunes under nonirrigated conditions in Shapotou area, the following principles for selection of sand-fixing species have been established. (1) Foreign species must be introduced from temperate sandylands and can withstand temperatures as low as -25°C; domestic species must be introduced from sandylands in semi-desert and desert zones with rainfall of less than 300 mm. Both pioneer and mid-stage plants in the successional processes should be considered for either windward or leeward slopes of moving sand dunes; tree species or species related to hydroseres should not be chosen. (2) Standards for the successful introduction include: higher survival rate, above 70 percent rapid growth, a persistent sand-fixing function in several years and the ability to produce flowers and seeds. They should have a longer life span (above ten years). Such species can be used to establish artificial vegetation on upwind slopes
or fix sand on leeward slopes. It is best if they can regenerate naturally.

Summary:
This paper presents studies on sandbreak effectiveness and other characteristics for different types of sandbreak belts. The amount of breaking sand and height and width of dunes in sandbreak forests of a single belt are determined using six parameters (structure of forest belt, permeability, composition of tree species, belt height, belt width and sand origin) Using variance analysis and the LSR method, the order of sandbreak efficacy for different types of sandbreak belts is as follows: single or multiple belt of forest and grass existing together, multiple belt of narrow and wooded tract, tight structure of single belt, sparse structure of single belt and aeration structure of single belt. Depending on natural conditions, degree of drift sand harm and water resource characteristics, the paper suggests an optimal model of sandbreak belt in the southern fringe of Junggar, Turpan and Tarim basins.

Summary:
Location experiments were conducted to study soil moisture balance in farmland under different rotation systems in loess hilly area, of South Ningxia. The results show that rotation between grain and bean (i.e. spring pea-spring wheat-spring wheat-broom corn millet) could adjust, maintain and balance soil moisture within the rotation period; alfalfa can be used in the rotation of grass crops. Soil moisture in a layer of one metre is suitable for planting drought-resistance crops, such as millet, after alfalfa has grown five to six years; soil moisture in a layer of two metres can be replenished after drought-resistance crops were planted for two to three years. Long-term continuous cropping of spring wheat can lead to decreased soil fertility and increased pests, diseases and weeds, as well as reduced productivity which causes soil moisture problems.

The numerical simulation of the features of the planetary boundary layer of the oasis and the Gobi Desert in the arid region
Publisher:
Journal of Desert Research. 15(2)
Date: 1995
Language: Chinese
Classification:
2Cb, 2Ea
Region:
North China
Summary:
In order to simulate and research the influence of the features of the Planetary Boundary Line (PBL) of the oasis and the Gobi Desert and underlying surfaces on precipitation, a two dimensional, high resolution PBL model coupled with the Bates scheme is used. The underlying surface is desert which is several hundred kilometres long. Results show that the oasis transports little sensible heat to the PBL; the peak is 60 w/m². Latent heat is large with a peak at 400 w/m². Due to transportation of sensible and latent heat over the oasis, a cold wet air column appears in the boundary and lower air. This column can reach a height of 650 hPa and the ground layer and temperature difference can reach tour degrees C; this case is called the "oasis cold-wet effect". In the desert region with less latent heat transport, the peak is 100 w/m2, but sensible heat transport is about 400w/m2. A hot-dry air column can reach a height of 600 hPa in the boundary layer and lower air over the
desert between the oasis. The maximum ground layer temperature difference is five degrees C; this case is called "desert hot-dry effect". Oases in the desert contribute to precipitation; cool-wet air transported by advection passes over the desert. It makes this layer unstable and precipitation increases over desert areas contiguous to the fringe of the oasis.

Dynamic variations in soil moisture caused by rainwater infiltration in bare sandyland
Publisher:

Date:
Classification:

Language:

Region:

Summary:
Shapotou Desert Experimental Research Station on the southern fringe of Tengger Desert has an annual rainfall of 186.2 mm. A neutron probe, tensiometer and automatic rain gauge were installed in bare sandy soil to measure soil moisture, soil moisture potential and rainfall amount and intensity. Results show that the water volume and suction power vary from high to low and from top to bottom during rainwater infiltration. The dividing line for brisk content of soil moisture is 0.6 m. Vertical transmission speed of soil moisture and rainfall conditions varies from 0.35-2.29 cm/hr. Infiltration speed of rainwater is low due to the existence of a dry sand layer. Soil water transmits quickly at first, then slows and tends to stabilize. Redistribution of rainwater plays a key role in the dynamic variation of soil moisture.

Summary:
This paper analyses drought, flood and precipitation trends based on monthly precipitation data from 1940-1991 collected at 25 stations in Inner Mongolia. Mean annual precipitation is 216.1 mm. Southern and western parts are arid zones; middle and eastern parts are semi-arid zones; annual precipitation variability is 15.6-38.0 percent. Droughts and floods are frequent in Inner Mongolia. The frequency of drought is higher than floods, but the frequency of severe floods is two times that of severe drought. Annual precipitation distribution is normal; it has quasi three year and 11-14-year periods. Annual precipitation increases average 0.34 mm over ten years. Annual precipitation increased at the rate of 5.13 mm/year in the 1980s and has continued to increase at the same rate in the 1990s.

Summary:
Natural factors influencing land desertification in Songhua Jiang and Nen Jiang Plain are as follows. (1) Neotectonic movement and vicissitudes of river bed development during the Quaternary created a wide deposit of sand in the river bed and floodplain, leaving large amounts of sand. (2) Windy and arid spring seasons in recent years have reduced precipitation making the area much drier, thus sand spreads more easily. Artificial factors influencing desertification include over cultivation, overgrazing and over harvesting of woodfuel. The authors propose the following measures to control land desertification. (1) Readjust the proportion of cultivated, forest and grassland; increase the proportion of forest and grassland. (2) Plant trees to prevent the harmful effects of wind and sand, including artificial ecological systems of arbour, shrub and grass on dunes, a compound ecological system of forest, grassland and farmland in flat areas and shelterbelt networks (3) Construct a
model three-dimensional ecological system for agriculture between sand dunes and pasture. (4) In residential areas build a courtyard economic system which ties together daily life activities, production and ecology. (5) Invest in policies that support contract forms of' production.

Summary:
The modern, dry climate environment of this desert started at the end of the Tertiary and formed in the Quaternary, although the arid environment of the Tarim Basin can be traced back to the Cretaceous period. This development period can be divided into the following stages: (1) arid tropic climate with little humid fluctuation from Cretaceous to early Oligocene; (2) semi-humid warm climate from late Oligocene to the end of Miocene; (3) arid warm climate in the Pliocene; (4) extremely arid climate with warm temperate and cold alternations. The age of the desert formation is much younger than arid environments generally, and most likely started in the late period of the middle Pleistocene or middle Pleistocene. All studies present two key development stages for the desert-one in the late period of the Pleistocene (17.0-17.5 ka B.P) which built up the foundation and outline of current landforms, and the other in the mid-Holocene (about 5.0 ka B.P) which completed the
development of the modern desert.

The mulch seeding with no tillage technique
Publisher:
Transaction of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. 6(3):3 1 -36
Date:
Language:

Classification:
6Ce
Region:
North China
Summary:
The concepts of conventional tillage, minimum tillage and mulch tillage are introduced and fundamentals of mulch seeding with no tillage described. Research which originally focused on summer corn is being extended. This new technology includes three field operations: wheat harvesting with straw chopping and spreading, direct seeding and fertilizing and weed control with herbicide spraying. It also includes techniques for seed treatment, mulching, direct seeding, granulated compound fertilizer application, herbicide spraying and insect control. The authors developed a mulch seeder (2BQM- 6D) as an essential tool for practicing the technology, which uses a chisel rather than the disc coulter used in other countries. The mulch seeder with chisel coulter is lighter, less costly and more suitable to Chinese conditions. The technology of the mulch seeding with no tillage for summer corn has produced remarkable economic, ecological and social benefits: increased yield, fuel
consumption savings, reduced labour requirements and soil and water conservation compared to conventional tillage. It differs from no till farming in that it is adopted only during summer; the field will be ploughed during autumn. The technology avoids problems created by continuous no till farming, without sacrificing its advantages. It offers an effective means to reap high yield wheat and corn production.

Summary:
The authors use meteorological data from five stations (Etoke, Dongsheng, Yanchi, Yulin, Ushenqi) in the Mu Us Sandy Land during spring seasons of the past 40 years to detail desertification related trends in climate change. Areas covered include aridity coefficients, cloud cover, precipitation, humidity, wind speed and number of wind-sand days. Spring conditions changed from being wetter in the 1960s to drier in the 1970's and wetter again in the 1980s. If this oscillation pattern over periods of approximately ten years is maintained, spring conditions will once again be drier. Power spectrums have been analyzed by time series (1955-1988) for precipitation and aridity coefficients; significant levels of 0.05 appear at two to three and eight to nine year intervals at each station. This oscillation of two to three years may be associated with SST of tropical oceans, subtropical highs over the western Pacific and cold air activity in the northern hemisphere which all have the
same periodic oscillation. The regression prediction models have also been established for precipitation and aridity coefficients. These models can predict springtime precipitation and aridity coefficients for the region from three to six months in advance. The ability of human activity to affect desertification and climatic change in various ways in the same climatic environment is also addressed.

Summary:
This report discusses productive potential and technical approaches for dryland farming in loess hilly areas, based on a cropping system for eroded tideland hilly areas in Pengang county, South Nongxia between 1986-1990. Cropping systems for dryland farming should consider the grassland-animal husbandry-nutrients-grain relationship as a focal point for building a drought-resistant system. Features included preservation of soil moisture, selection and introduction of appropriate varieties of crops, and optimal tillage and cultivation practices. This system is the foundation to guarantee higher and steady yields from dryland farms in loess hilly areas.

Classification:
2B, 2Eb
Region:
Wind action creates sand dune movement; land surface wind is effected by local landforms. In Altai Xinjiang the direction of sand dune movements is complex: from April to September dunes on both sides of the western Ertix River and between the Ertix and Ulungur Rivers move eastward and southeastward; during the rest of the year dunes on the north side of the Ertix River move westward or northwestward. Local weather is also effected by the arctic air mass. Mongolian High Pressure acted upon the study area during the winter half of the year. Higher relief of local landforms also directly effects wind direction and, therefore, controls the moving direction of dunes.

Summary:
Collecting and storage of water using land preparation engineering was analysed in accordance with the principle of water equilibrium and runoff movement. Land preparation engineering can adjust soil moisture of tree planting pits. The average amount of water collected by the engineers correlated positively with other water collection areas and precipitation which causes runoff. If the water collection area is 1.5 m^2, 2.0 m^2, and 2.5 m^2, the water collected is 29.22 kg, 33.95 kg and 37.58 kg, respectively. In comparing three engineering measures, the average annual water storage of the reverse-slope terrace is the highest, up to 26.5 mm; that of contour trenches, 24.8 mm; and fish scale pits the lowest, at only 20.7 mm. Rainfall plays a dominant role in soil water storage. Prediction models for collecting water from individual rainfalls by land preparation engineering methods has extensive practical applications.

Summary:
Three large belts of sandyland run in a south-north direction, with a light-yellow fine sand layer containing two or three layers of paleosols in the Hulun Buir Sandy Land. Spore pollen and 14C dating indicate that this sandyland has experienced four fixed periods and four mobile periods of change since the Holocene. The paleosol layers contain small amounts of wood pollen; herb pollens are abundant. From early to late Holocene the paleo-botanical succession series were subdesert steppe-Artemisia, steppe-sparse forest, steppe-Chenopodiaceae and weed steppe. All of these vegetation types belong to grassland on sandy soil. Existing sandy grassland should be protected in accordance with the succession laws of ancient vegetation.

Summary:
This study observed the sand-fixing effect of Salix flavida Chang et Skv, Caragana microphylla Lam., and Hedysarum mongolicum Turcz. when planted on sandy soil. Sand movements were effectively stopped by the plants' canopies. The velocity of wind within plantations was greatly reduced, damage from soil erosion was less and a large amount of litter accumulated under the canopies. Plantations of S. flacvida produced the greatest quantity of litter with 3.5-3.9 tons per ha; A. Halodendron produced the least with 0.31 tons per ha. The mechanical structure of the top layer of soil became finer and the volume weight, lighter. Nutrient condition improved, i.e. nitrogen and particularly potassium, with marked increases in humus. Tree plantations should be established within two to three years after dunes have been stabilised by the plants; the escarpment should be larger than normal.

Summary:
This paper deals with three aspects of aerial sowing for afforestation: site, species and time. Comparisons were made of the results of aerial sowing in tour environments, arid, semi-arid, semi-humid and humid. The biological characteristics and regularity of surviving seed from Pinus massoniana, P. yunnanensis, P. tabulaeformis, Astragalus adsurgens and Hedysarum monglolicum was analysed to determine which species are most suitable for aerial sowing. Aerial sowing can be done throughout the year depending upon rainfall and temperatures in different regions. Chinese advances in aerial sowing technology over the past 20 years verify its potential for afforestation.

Summary:
The Tarim River, situated in the southern part of Xinjiang, is the longest interior river in China. In this study a typical region in. the middle reaches of the Tarim River was selected to examine desertification changes and its causes. Desertification trends during the last 30 years are due to increased population and farming and related water storage problems. It is predicted that desertification will continue to worsen until 2001. Sand and salt layers are so thick on the surface that land conditions are no longer suitable for growing vegetation. There is an extremely urgent need to strengthen environmental management and develop new water resources in South Xinjiang.

Summary:
Semi-cement, medium-fine sand sediment with red (10 R4/8) or brown-red (2.5 YR 4/8) colour, known as "Old Red Sediment", is irregularly distributed southward along the coast of South China from Pingtan Island in Fujian province. The authors conducted field investigations and laboratory analysis to confirm that "Old Red Sandy Sediment" belongs to the coastal aeolian deposit formed in the last glacial period of late Pleistocene. This finding is based on the sediment's distribution, landform pattern, deposition and age. Experimental research also showed that the red colour of the sediment contributes to a film of red clay material on the surface of uncoloured quartz sands, which is composed of clay minerals (i.e. kaolinite), mixed with ferric oxides such as hematite and goethite. These clay minerals were formed by the weathering of minerals such as feldspar in the pale-aeolian sands under wet and hot climate conditions during the high-temperature, sub-interglacial or
post-glacial period. The ferric oxides are derived from oxidized ferric-silicate minerals. Development of the "Old Red Sandy Sediment" went through two stages: the coastal aeolian deposition stage in the sub-glacial period ( lower sea level) and a weathering (oxidization) stage in the sub-interglacial or post-glacial high temperature period (higher sea level). The former is the original formation process for coastal aeolian deposits and the latter is the intense subsequent oxidization (laterization) process. The time of laterization is no more than 10 000 years.

Comparative study of the surface texture of quartz sand in inland deserts and coastal dunes of China
Publisher:
Journal of Desert Research. 15(3)
Date:
Language:
Chinese
Classification:

Region:

Summary:
This paper uses a Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM) analysis to make a comparative study of the surface texture of quartz sand in inland deserts to that in coastal dunes. The study shows that quartz grains in both inland deserts and coastal dunes have enhanced roundness, with the characteristic features such as dished pit (D), pockmarked pit (P), and silica (SiO^2) on the surface, which represent the aeolian environment. Other characteristics such as V-shaped percussion pit (V), percussion furrow reflect the origin of protosand Material. Due to environmental (especially climate) there are differences in surface textures. (1) Sand located in inland arid areas with continental climate underwent stronger aeolian mechanical action and chemical sediment action than the coastal dune sand located in humid areas with monsoon climate. The coastal dune sand shows greater evidence of chemical corrosion than the inland desert sand. (2) Even in the same coastal dune environment,
the surface texture of quartz sand in the northern temperate zone shows stronger traces of mechanical action than that in the south tropical zone; yet, the latter shows more developed chemical and mechanical action.

A superficial view of Desertification in North China

Language:

Classification:
1, 2B
Region:
North China
Summary:
This paper presents views on Desertification process of arid, semi-arid and semi-humid areas in the North China based on research. Desertification is an environmental formation or development of a sand desert-a deterioration process in which the desert is the last or terminal result. Desertification creates a distinct geographic environment. Desertification can occur not only in "unoriginal sand desert areas" but also in original sand desert areas, because of the extension and intensification of sand desert conditions. The causes of Desertification and sand deserts in North China have been changing since the Quaternary. Changes during geological periods of the Quaternary were due to global climatic change during glacial periods and were a kind of "pure" or natural processes- climate-induced geomorphic processes. Changes due to human history belong to a "natural/man-made" process, i.e. climatic and human-induced changes are ones which are mainly controlled by climatic
conditions but partly influenced by human activities. The author thinks that the sand desert in the broad semi-desert and steppe areas of the eastern part of North China, existed periodically during the geological stages of Quaternary before historical times and under went several positive and negative changes, i.e. expansive and retroactive processes and naturally stable ones. Desertification occurring during the period of human history is still in a developmental stage. A one hundred year long dry period and sharp increases in population combined with the negative effects of improper economic development are causing Desertification in North China to worsen.

Classification:

Summary:
Decertified areas in northern China expanded slightly during the past 30 years. This is manifested in vegetation destruction, reduced areas of fixed sand dunes, considerably increased areas of semi-fixed and mobile sand dunes and intensified desertification processes generally. The evolutionary trend of deserts will be largely controlled by future climatic change: increased concentration of greenhouse gas CO[2] caused by human activities and global climatic variations. Precipitation in the eastern part of China may increase, which will be favourable for the alleviation or reversing of the desertification process. Drought in the western desert areas may be intensified, which will promote the further development of the desertification.

Summary:
The Tarim oil-transporting highway passes through the hinterland of the Taklimakan Desert, which is one of the largest mobile dune fields in the world. Geological and geomorphologic conditions are quite complex along the highway line which experiences frequent sand-raising winds and higher sand transport rates. Construction of the desert highway faced two key technical problems: how to consolidate the sandy subbase and how to control wind sand damages. Both problems have been solved through cooperative research efforts of experts from different disciplines. As to the former, a sub-grade structure consisting of vibrantly compacted subbase, thin layer gravel and a beotextile structural layer was adopted. For the latter, mechanical sand barriers, chemical mulch and biological measures were used.

3Bd, 4Bb, 4Bc, 4Bd, 6Da
Region:
Qing Zang plateau, China
Summary:
The Shiquanhe River valley lies in western Tibet. With increasing human economic activities and over utilization of natural resources, original landscapes have been damaged, plant coverage decreased from 40-60 percent to 10-30 percent and hydrophyte and mesophyte degraded or totally destroyed. A dry-cold and windy climate combined with a ground surface of alluvial-pluvial deposits are the main causes of wind erosion and desertification. Desertification processes in the region are related to the environmental evolution of the Qingi Zang Plateau and are manifest in three ways: (1) Aridisation. The dry and cold climate in the region gradually caused the shrub meadow dominated by Mtricaria elegans to turn into decertified meadow dominated by Caragana versicolor. Vegetation communities are developing towards xerophyte types; soil and water conservation capabilities have decreased. (2) Salinisation. Evaporation of soil instead of transpiration of vegetation has resulted in the
accumulation of salts, soil exposure and severe drought; meadow soil has become meadow salty soil. (3) Desertification. Abundant sand resources and wind force conditions have made desertification the most serious environmental problem in the Shiquanhe River valley. Frequent wind erosion resulted in mobile sand forming high bracken dunes on flat sandyland, while meadow soil changed into sandy soil. It is noticeable that 85 percent of the land in the region has been subjected to the degradation processes described above. Desertification control requires measures suitable to local conditions.

Summary:
Sand damage to railways manifest in many forms, such as sand deposition on roadbeds, deflation and abrasion of machine equipment, train derailment and interruption of normal traffic transport. Different sand control systems along railway lines in the Gobi and other desert areas have been adopted in accordance with sand damage conditions. In the Shapotou section of Baotou-Lanzhou Railway sand control systems include the establishment of enclosed belts, upright fences at the front side of sand dunes, straw checkerboard barriers and irrigated forest belts along both sides of the railway. In the Shixiazi section of Ganwu Railway, where there is no water source available for irrigation, sand control systems consist entirely of straw checkerboard barriers along both sides of the railway line.

Key measures to regenerate air-sowed shrubs and grasses on sandy land
Publisher:
Journal of Arid Land Resources and Environment. 6(2):19-26
Date:
Language:

Classification:

Region:

Summary:
Air-sowing of shrubs and grasses on shifting sandyland in steppe or desert steppe zones is an effective method for sand control and development of animal husbandry. From 1979 to 1988, air-sowed areas had reached 53 million ha of forage grasses on Mu Us Sandy Land, Horqin Sandy Land and the eastern fringe of Tengger Desert, representing 36 million ha of regenerated decertified and degraded pastureland. Serious degeneration is taking place, however, in local air-sown areas due to crust formation on sand surfaces which prevents rainfall from seeping into the subsoil layer. The key measure to resolve this situation is to keep air-sowing areas on sand surfaces in a semi-fixed condition. This can be done by proper stock grazing, which makes use of animal trampling to destroy the crust.

Region:
North China
Summary:
In this paper, annual aridity coefficients, annual rainfall and accumulated temperature are used as indices for the classification of arid climate. Arid areas are divided into two great types, three patterns and 15 zones. Arid areas belong to continental climates-dry with scarce rainfall. Rainfall decreases rapidly from east (500 mm) to west (10 mm), and is concentrated during summer. Heavy rain seldom occurs, but once it does, residents often experience floods and related disasters. Wind force in the arid area is great causing sandstorms. There is less lower cloud cover and longer sunshine periods in arid areas as compared to humid areas. Air temperature is low in winter and high-in summer. The range of annual and daily air temperature variation is the largest in China. During rainy season, abundant sunshine and heat are advantageous to crop growth.

Classification:
2Cc, 3C, 4Aa
Region:

Summary:
Analytical results of stratigraphy, sedimentary structure, grain size, quartz grain micro-texture, fauna and pollen spore analysis reveal that an aeolian sand land formation process existed in the Neogene period in southeastern Tengger Desert, which is similar to today's sand transport and accumulation processes. A large number of calcareous crusts and nodules in sand dune fields showed that the climate in the area at that time was dry and hot. From this perspective it ranged from sub-tropic spare wood steppe to desert steppe. According to geomorphic characteristics it can be divided into paleo-eolian sand of a sand dune phase and paleo-eolian sand of a piedmont phase. Apart from the orange red or brown red colour, both paleo-eolian sands have similar deposition characteristics to recent sandy desert.

Summary:
This article analyses the characteristics and causes of two sandstorms which occurred in April 1990. Samples collected in Yulin, Yan'an, Taiyuan, Hohhot and Beijing were used to calculate sandstorm trajectories and chemical and physical features to determine the source areas. In periods of sandstorm activity total suspended particle (TSP) concentrations are higher than normal by several times. The aerosols of sandstorms consist of mainly natural lithosphere elements from the earth's crust, which are distributed in large particles (d£3/42.1 | Ìm). Polluted elements from human activity appear as small particles (d£1/42.1 | Ìm); their enrichment factors are sharply reduced during the sandstorm.

Summary:
Situated at southwestern margin of Ulan Buh Desert in Inner Mongolia, the Jartal Salt Lake is plagued with shifting sand encroachment. Since 1983 the Jartal Salt Lake area has adopted various measures to control sand damages to the salt lake. Main measures include protecting sandyland from animal disturbance for grass growth and establishing sand break forests. To establish vegetation successfully, some drought-resistant plant species were selected and sprinkling irrigation installed. Clay barriers are used in sand stabilization; their optimal sizes are 1 x 1 m and 1 x 2 m. After using these methods wind velocity near the ground surface was reduced by 13.3-13.7 percent. Prior to adopting control measures sand volume transported into the lake was 1.275 million m^3 per year; it has now been reduced to 367 000 m^3 per year.

Summary:
According to ten-year monitoring data, land desertification in northern China is expanding at an annual rate of 2 103.2 km², especially in the agropastoral regions. In the past ten years 24 000 km^2 of fertile land have been lost to desertification, corresponding to 6.6 km^2 per day. In the "three-north" region the ratio between greening velocity and desertification velocity is one to eight, indicating that rehabilitation of decertified land in China is relatively slow. The rehabilitation of decertified land requires complex, systematic engineering solutions; zone differences must be considered. Relationships between land development and protection, decertified land rehabilitation and production, ecological and economic benefits, land enclosure and fuel supply must be handled correctly. In order to speed up rehabilitation of decertified land, biological measures should be developed in conjunction with water conservancy projects.

Summary:
China faces a serious desertification problem, especially in the interlaced farming-grazing areas; 6.67 million ha of farmland and grassland are threatened with desertification. During the past ten years, an additional 24 800 km^2 of productive land have been reduced to desertificated land. This means that desertification in China is expanding at a rate of 2 103.2 km^2 per year. Present measures to halt the development of desertification include: regenerating natural vegetation on sandyland, establishing artificial vegetation and fixing drift sand. Ten-year monitoring data showed that 45 300 km^2 of desertificated land in northern China have been brought under control, which occupies 13 percent of China's total decertified land area. In addition, about desertification processes on 10 000 km^2 land have reversed which accounts for six percent of China's total desertificated land area.

Summary:
According to investigation of tree and shrub mixed sand-holding forests in northern Linze oasis, wind reduction and micro-climatic improvements increase with prolonged afforestation. After eight years of afforestation, sand dunes have been stabilized, wind speed reduced by above 50 percent, air relative humidity increased by six to eight percent and evaporation potentiality reduced by 43 to 60 percent. After 12 years, each ha of the forest can provide 262.8 m^3 of timber, 39 t of firewood charcoal and 51 t of litter-fall (dry weight) which contains 1873.5 kg of (NH[4])[2]SO[4], 96 kg of Ca[3](PO[4])2 and 2872.5 kg of Cl. The net output is 53 479.2 yuan/ha. Mixed sand holding forests offer both ecological and economic benefits and should be popularized in arid areas.

Summary:
A density trial of Populus Zhaolin 6' in an intensive culture plantation was conducted from 1984 to 1989 in a semi-arid area of Jianping county, Liaoning province. The results showed the following. (1) There were great differences in forest tree growth, stand structure and economic benefit among the three planting densities treated in this trial. (2) The number of forest trees showed a normal distribution by allocation of diameter classes. (3) The shape of tree stems and their amplitude were also affected by density. (4) Diameter class and yield of forest trees were affected by density, which greatly influence potential economic benefit from the plantation. The average annual production value of 6-year-old stands with densities of 4 m x 4 m, 4 m x 6 m and 5 m x 6 m was 3300.27 yuan(RMB)/ha, 3361.00 yuan/ha and 3009.50 yuan/ha respectively. Under local conditions plantations of 4 m x 4 m and 4 m x 6 m were suitable for developing middle-diameter timber, cutting ten to
12-year-old stands. Plantations of 5 m x 6 m were suitable for developing large-diameter timber, cutting 12-15-year-old stands, from which a satisfactory timber yield and great economic benefit could be achieved

Summary:
The structure and dynamics of the land resources system in the shelter forest region of the Dongbei Plain was analysed using remote sensing and statistical information from typical profiles and spots. In terms of agricultural utilization, the land resources system is made up of five components, i.e. man, land resources, water resources, climate resources and barren land. The local economy is heavily dependent on the land resources, especially farmland. After 50-60 years (from 1930s to 1980s) of exploitation, the land has already changed from a reclaiming period into a declining period. There is no waste land to be reclaimed. In light of increased population, demands on land and decreased farmland fertility, proper management of land resources is indispensable if the local economy and living standards are to be maintained. This will not be possible without artificial regeneration (the highest input) and a healthy ecosystem. Relying on natural regeneration only will result in
further degradation.

Summary:
By 1987, 67 000 ha of enclosed areas that were fenced to exclude grazing animals had been established in oases and desert fringe areas in Xinjiang and Gansu provinces. After two to three years of fencing the vegetation cover and grass yield in the closed pasture fields increased by 15-17 percent and 20-100 percent, respectively. Increasing the enclosed area worsens the problem of overgrazing in the open rangeland. Thus far overgrazing has resulted in 61 000 km^2 of decertified land in northern China. Experiments show that rational utilization of enclosed pasture can contribute to maintaining the ecological balance in desert regions and facilitate animal husbandry development in northern China

Summary:
The relationship between vegetation and water and soil conservation were studied in North China. The results showed that annual recovery increments of vegetation in mountainous areas is 9.2 percent on the northern slope and 9.05 percent on the southern slope. In hill areas annual recovery increments are 8.3 percent on the northern slope and 7.6 percent on the southern slope. After vegetation recovery, the runoff process is shortened, peak flow is lowered, permeability of the soil increased and the amount of runoff lessened. When vegetation increased one percent, the coefficient of runoff decreased 1.04- 1.2 percent accordingly. If vegetation cover reached 90 percent, runoff would be fundamentally controlled. Soil surface erosion is therefore in inverse proportion to vegetation cover. When vegetation cover is less than 60 percent, the curve of soil surface erosion is elevated to a 45° angle.

Summary:
Situated in the southeastern fringe of the Tengger Desert, the Shapotou area is covered with large tracts of sand dunes; a 42 km section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway line crosses the area. To ensure smooth operation of the railway an artificial protective system, which emphasis a "fixation" and "block" approach has been established since 1965. After 30 years this practice has proved that artificial protective systems, using vegetation dune stabilization as a main measure and mechanical dune stabilization as an auxiliary measure, is feasible and effective under conditions of an annual rainfall of 186 mm. Once the vegetation is established on the dunes, soil development takes place which then forms a biological crust that makes mobile sand dunes stable. As time goes on, the original environment changes, causing artificial ecosystems to evolve towards natural ecosystems.

Summary:
Protecting desertificated rangeland from livestock grazing is an effective measure to combat rangeland desertification caused by overgrazing. This method is widely used in North China. This study seeks to determine subsequent changes in vegetation and landscape. Vegetation and landforms in three enclosures, which were protected from livestock grazing for two, three and eight years in Naiman Banner were investigated. Nine types of plant communities were recognized according to vegetation classification. Alter several years of protection from livestock grazing, the plant cover and number of plant community types increased and the amount of shifting sand within enclosures was reduced. Above ground plant biomass may follow a sigmoid curve, increasing at the beginning of protection from livestock grazing and declining later due to vegetation succession. A comparative analysis showed that the vegetative biomass in enclosures kept increasing over eight years on severely decertified
rangeland with the most rapid increases in the first three years.

Summary:
The relationship between vegetation degeneration and soil salinisation in an Aneurolopidium chinese grassland of Songhua Jiang and Nen Jiang Plain is discussed in this paper. Importance Value (IV), Relative coverage (C') and Relative Above-ground Biomass (W') are used as indicators of vegetation degeneration. Electrical Conductivity (EC) and Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP) are used as indices of soil salinisation. The relationships among IV, C', EC and ESP can be best described by IV=60.1*0.69EC. IV=64.03*0.97ESP, C'=95.48*0.95ESP, and C'=96.2*0.56EC. This suggests that IV and C' are negatively correlated with EC and ESP of the soil. It is shown that W' is positively correlated with both soil organic matter (OM) and hydrolysable nitrogen (N) contents. Both EC and ESP can be described as a function of OM. The regression equations are EC=8.84*0.850 m. The results indicate that the saline soil of Songnen Plain can be effectively ameliorated by increasing soil organic
matter and nitrogen inputs.

Region:
North China
Summary:
Land degradation processes include soil erosion, desertification, salinisation, alkalisation, swamping, soil fertility loss, and the degradation of soil structure and soil pollution are caused by wind, water and human influence. The Loess Plateau is situated in the central part of China, with an area of 623.7 million ha, an arid and semi-arid continental monsoon climate, strong winds in spring and torrential rains in autumn. The original parent material of the soil is mainly loess. The vegetation coverage is tenuous and the soil, nutrient-poor. This study, using remote sensing, showed that in the Loess Plateau both natural conditions and the influence of human activity have caused severe land degradation. More than 80 percent of the total area experiences water and soil erosion problems; the land degradation index is more than five. In the very fragile environment of this region land degradation has increased rapidly, leading to an astonishing loss of soil nutrient.

Summary:
Located in the middle and northern parts of Ningxia, the desert steppe covers an area of 32 020 km^2, with a population of 2.9 million persons or 62 percent of the total population of Ningxia. Landforms in the region can be divided into eleven types: swampy depression, oasis, clay and silt flat land, high flat land, gently sloping land, valley and gully land, terrace, hill and low mountain, middle mountain and water bodies, According to land suitability for farming, forestry and animal husbandry, land in the area can be divided into nine quality grades, Land in the first one to four grades is suitable for farming. grades five to seven are suitable for afforestation and grade eight is unsuitable for any use. Land area suitable for farming comprises 8 503.53 km^2; for afforestation and animal husbandry, 8 221.08 km^2 and 13 016.21 km^2, respectively. Land area suitable for animal husbandry occupies 40.64 percent of the total area, while those suitable for farming and
afforestation only occupy 26.55 percent and 25.69 percent, respectively. Animal husbandry therefore plays a leading role in the region.

Summary:
Arid zones (including semi-arid zones) are widely distributed from the west of the Da Hinggan Mountain, through the Taihang Mountain, Liupan Mountain, and Bayan Har Mountains, to the Nyainqentanglha Range in China. In the past 40 years, and in especially the last ten, China has made great progress in arid zones research; some fields rank among the world's most advanced. Arid zones research involves the following activities: (1) inventory and evaluation of natural resources, including land, water, climate and biological and mineral resources; and (2) monitoring and control of natural disasters. Research emphasises disasters such as drought and salinisation, and particularly, sandstorm control. (3) The evaluation and prediction of geographical environments is important because natural evolution and the effect of human activities is causing the geographical environment in arid zones to change continually. (4) Analysis of production allocations to industry, agriculture and
transport is needed to meet national economic development needs and to address production pressures now being placed on arid zones. (5) Population dynamics considered the growth of national minority populations, the population and economy of mountainous areas, population and environment and northwest migration. Policies for adjusting industrial structure and coordinating development are proposed. (6) Regional research and development focuses on large-scale development for the next century. Future efforts should expand the range and depth of arid zones research, especially strengthening comprehensive and regional research activities.

Classification:

Region:

Summary:
These authors seek to understand the influence of global change and continental shelf environmental change since Quaternary, and especially the Late Pleistocene, on shelf sedimentary environments in China. Progress in future studies of shelf sedimentary environments may focus on the following fields: (1) Exploring the relationship between formation of the great Qinghai-Xizang ice sheet and the Yangtze River delta deposits. Geomorphologists have various views about the characteristics of China's continental shelf during the glacial epoch, especially the range and scope of the paleo-glacier. Temperature was lower, the scope of glacier was wide, the snowline was lower, the main precipitation was solid state and runoff of the Yangtze River was much less than it is today. Changes in the natural environment of the Yangtze River valley may have controlled changes in the Yangtze River's runoff and influenced the development of the Yangtze River delta. (2) The close relationship
between loess and deserts is examined; loess is always accompanied by deserts. Loess on China's continental shelf is related to several main cold waves. Along the cold wave route, deserts appear first, then areas of loess distribution. In the continental shelf region, the same regularity is observed. Large desert ranges can be found on the windward side of continental loess. (3) Some of the new evidence of desertification of the shell deposits in the last stage of the Late Pleistocene includes: (a) endless erosion surfaces, (b) thick accumulation of mixed deposits, (c) typical "angle of repose " texture, (d) disintegration of united marine stratum and (e) overlapping of submarine dune deposits.

Summary:
There is a large area suitable for high yield plantations of poplar in the cold semi-arid areas of North China. Wide utilization of good clones of P. euramericana and P. deltoides in this area is restricted by the dry and cold climate. Forty-five poplar clones were recently selected from high latitudes of Europe and America and their growth potential studied. Four clones of P. eurmericana and one clone of P. Deltoides were chosen based on analysis of isolated growth seedling, and disease and cold resistance. Cluster analysis of selected clones is 14.5- 16.8 m in the six year-old plantation, the average DBH, 19.5-22.9 cm, the average volume per tree, 0.1956-0.3126 m; form figure of the stem is 0.4476-0.4650. Average volume increment per ha per year for these clones is 46.3-134.2 percent higher than the control cultivar, P. beijingensis. Yield levels of poplar plantations in this area will be increased by extending the use these cold-resistant and fast growing clones.

Summary:
A catastrophic sandstorm occurred at 1400-2000 on 5 May 1993 in the desert area of northwest China. The height of the dust cloud varied between 300-400 m, with maximum height reaching 700 m. The frontal dust cloud advanced at a mean velocity of 50-80 km/hr. with a maximum velocity of 76 km/hr, instantaneous wind velocity 20 m/s or more, and maximum wind speed 34 m/s. The visibility near ground surface ranged from 0-100 m. This sandstorm caused great damage to industrial and agricultural production in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu province, Alxa region of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia. It has been estimated that the direct economic loss amounted to 236 million yuan. According to survey and analytical data in several typical regions, the damage occurred mainly in the old oases and newly opened irrigation regions, where there were no perfect shelterbelts. The main countermeasures to control sandstorms include establishment of psammophile vegetation, large-scale sandbreak forests,
farmland shelterbelts and protection of existing vegetation.

Application of commercial ectomycorrhizal inocula on container-grown Chinese Pine seedlings for afforestation in Loess Plateau
Publisher:
Scientia Silvae Sinicae. 29(5):401-407
Date:
Language:

Classification:

Summary:
A commercial inoculum of Suillus grevillei, produced with a liquid fermentor, was inoculated onto container-grown Chinese pine seedlings, together with the spore slurry of Pisolithus tinctorins, bacteria inoculum and phosphate fertilizer in different combinations. After only 100 days of growth, the mycorrhizal seedlings were used for afforestation on Chinese Loess Plateau. The results of this four-year experiment showed that the optimum treatment was the combination of S. grevillei, bacteria and phosphate fertilizer; the treatment which consisted of the combination of mycorrhizal fungi and fertilizer performed better than the one which used only mycorrhizal fungi; the treatment which used only fertilizer performed better than the control treatment, but was not as good as other treatments. Based on these findings, mycorrhizal fungi can enhance the growth of seedlings, especially in dry weight and phosphate absorption, increase the survival rate of afforestation and continue
to exert attributes which accelerate the growth of seedlings in afforestation sites after three years.

Region:

Summary:
This paper uses the results of experiments conducted in the open: and in wind tunnels to propose a new index for evaluating the effect of shelterbelts: X[i] (a ratio of the average gap between tree crowns to the average height of the belts). This study has shown that X[j] is useful for planning and designing shelterbelts and can also be used to judge the sheltering effect of belts growing in fields. The protective character and mechanisms of three types of belts are studied in the paper. The results are briefly summarized as follows: 1) The influence range of different types of belts extends about 4 H in the vertical range and 50 H in the horizontal range. The distance where wind speed reductions are still at least 20 percent occurs 18.5 H behind belts with a permeability of 35 percent. The value of wind speed in the lee of belts is closely related with turbulence (r =.94). 2) X[j] is a important index for expressing the effect of the belts on air flow as well as
permeability. The optimum X' for each row in the belts having one row and eight rows is given in the paper.

Summary:
Measurements of synchronous and relative values of wind velocity were calculated with 56 probes at four levels in aerial-seeded land and moving dunes in the Yulin area of Mu Us Desert in 1988. The results showed remarkable conservation benefits from aerial-seeded Hedysarum mongolica Turcz. and Hedysarum scoparium Fisch et Mey, especially that of H. mongolica. The former vegetation belt was widened from 24 m to 35 m because of germination of the subterraneous stem. The rate of survival area increased from 17.7 percent to more than 60 percent ten years later and the land changed to stabilized sand land. Slopes of reformed dunes became smaller, and their length, longer; heights were lowered and the tops of dunes projected forward in a tongue shape. The land between dunes became smaller. Changes of topographic features of aerial-seeded land also occurred. Wind velocity was reduced horizontally and vertically. Although the moving dune was protected for ten years, it was still
without vegetation on slope and continued moving forward. Thus, aerial seeding in the farther place and artificial seeding in the near place are considered to be good methods to control the dunes. It should be promoted in the future.

Classification:

Region:

Summary:
Wind and sand movement occur frequently between March and June. The pattern of desert drift close to oases increases; wind and sand movement endangers oases in the leeward direction. Serious wind and sand disasters have occurred in the following oases: Mosuowan Oases, Jinghe and Aibi Lake Regions, Oases of Kashgar Region, Oases of Hetian Region and oases distributed in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. There is a trend toward more frequent wind and sand disasters in the oases of Xinjiang. Desertificated land is continuously expanding on the periphery of oases and in the lower reaches of rivers. Wind and sand disasters seldom occurs in the hinterland of irrigation oases, especially in the large-scale oases. Wind below force six usually do not cause wind and sand disasters. Although most oases are able to prevent damage from outburst gales and duststorm above force eight to nine, endangerment still exists. The desert vegetation on the periphery of oases is being reduced
and desertificated land is expanding. The main factors that induce wind and sand disasters and related control measures are as follows. In Xinjiang many rivers' water supplies in the lower reaches have been cut off. To counter this tendency, Xinjiang has started to plan works on major river valleys. An emergency water-infusion project has been carried out in the Tarim River. Oil and natural gas exploitation in desert areas and the construction of wind power stations in pastoral areas lightens artificial pressure on desert vegetation and helps protect desert vegetation in the periphery of oases.

Summary
Soil algae in surface crusts of deserts in Shapotou were identified and studied over a ten-month period (from May 1991 to February 1992). The result showed that five genera of Cyanophyta, six genera of Chlorophyta and two genera of Bacillariophyta occurred at the study site. The average algae biomass in soil was 8.117 (104 cells/g dry soil). Physical and chemical properties of the soil crust were analysed, which included pH, water-soluble cations (K^+, Na^+, Ca^+, Mg^+), moisture, electric conductivity, exchangeable salts, phosphorus, organic matter and Kjeldahl nitrogen. Applying these properties and three climatic factors (i.e. air and soil temperature, precipitation) as independent variables, the correlation coefficient between each of them and biomass was calculated. Algae biomass was significantly influenced by exchangeable salts (r=0.584). A multiple regression equation was obtained; algae biomass was also significantly influenced by water-soluble Mg^+ and
precipitation (R^2=0.79)

Publisher:
Acta Ecological Sinica. 11(1):1-6
Date:
Language:

Classification:
6Ed
Region:
Inner Mongolia, China
Summary:
Increased densities (i.e. from 1.1-2 percent to 9.6 percent) in artificial grazing forest leads to a decrease, from 88 percent to 62 percent, in relative wind speed. The natural grazing forest with densities of 19 percent and mean heights of 7 m has relative wind speeds of 62 percent compared to open areas and the forest with densities of 59 percent and 9 m of mean height registers only 22 percent in wind speed. The results of modeling experiments of grazing forest in a wind tunnel indicate that if the closeness of the grazing forest is three percent, six percent and 25 percent, the relative wind speed would be 64 percent, 60 percent and 45 percent, respectively. This means that wind speed within the forest will be reduced as the closeness of the forest increases. In addition, an increase in the closeness of the forest will increase the roughness of woodland from 1/20 to 1/70 of the height of the forest stand. In the grazing forest, as compared with open wildness,
evaporation was reduced by 12-20 percent, while transpiration was increased by 7.3 percent.

Summary:
Desertification is the impoverishment of terrestrial ecosystems due to human impact. Land degradation due to poor management has long plagued North China. From 1950s to the middle of 1970s, the area of degraded land expanded an average of 1560 km^2 annually and during the last decade increased to 2100 km^2 in northern China. Total area of degraded land is approximately 197 000 km^2. Desertification is very serious in exploited sandy steppe areas and near coal mines A number of measures for land conservation have proven feasible and effective in controlling the process of desertification and the productive potential of cultivated land and pasture has been gradually restored.

Summary:
This book describes in detail the occurrence, development and rehabilitation of desertificated land. The following points are emphasized. Desertification is a process of degradation in environments similar to that of deserts, consisting of blown undulating sand sheets and mobile dunes, which occurs when fragile ecosystems such as those with loose sandy surfaces in arid, semi-arid and parts of sub-humid zones, are exposed to drought and frequent wind. Desertification causes desert-like landscapes in aboriginal non-desert territory. This process causes decline in biomass productivity and reduces arable land resources. Since Desertification is an ecological issue and an environmental problem, studies should deal with the process systematically and as a whole, including historical and modern processes and physical and rehabilitation process of desertification. Desertification-prone land covers 334 000 km^2 the decertified land area is 176 000 km^2 and that at risk of
Desertification is 158 000 km^2. Environmental changes caused by Desertification manifest in the occurrence and growth of desert-like environments and landscapes. From aerial-survey topographic maps, desertification prone land has increased by 390 000 km^2 between 1950-1970. The rehabilitation of desertificated land and desertification-prone areas should focus on the rational development of resources.

Summary:
In Maqu area, the main cause of desertification is climatic change. According to field work and 14C dating, desertification in the area experienced four periods: 2 600-1 900 a B.P., 1 900-750 a B. P., 750-220 a B.P. and 220 a B.P. Only in the period 220 a B.P. to the present has the desertification process been influenced by both climatic change and human activities. Desertification processes in this area are consistent with Chinese climatic change and desertification processes in Genghe basin. With prolonged deflation, minerals steadily accumulate and sand becomes well-sorted; the aeolian sand comes mainly from deposits of the Huana He River.

Summary:
This paper presents the possibility of transforming and improving the desert ecosystem of the Qing Zang (Tibet) plateau into an agricultural ecosystem based on practical experiences at Xingride Farm, even though the former appears to be simple in structure, low in function and weak in ecosystem balance. Xingride Farm is situated in the southeastern Qaidam basin. There are sufficient water sources nearby and intense solar radiation beneficial to plant growth; the area experiences a windy cold arid climate and low soil fertility. Initially an irrigation system was developed to meet plant water requirements. Over a ten-year period shelterbelts and wind-protection vegetation was established to cover 13.4 percent of the cropland area. The micro climate of fields was improved and wind damage greatly reduced. Salt soil was improved, along with the fertility of other lands through crop rotation systems. The total crop yield gained by the farm in 1978 increased 12 percent compared
with that of 1965. Average grain yields of 3 097 kg/ha represented a 34.7 percent increase over 1965 and was twice as much as that in 1956. The highest average grain yield of wheat for spring reached up to 15 195 kg/ha in an experimental plot covering an area of 0.21 ha in 1978. In recent years, the crop yields have been gradually higher and more stable. And at the same time, animal husbandry, profitable forests and forest by-products have also been developed. This provides preliminary indications that transformation and improvement of desert grassland ecosystems are possible.

Summary:
The main factors that influence evaluation of site quality include flow degree, position and size of sand-hills and non-site factors such as age, density and cutting. Above ground biomass is used as an index for evaluating site quality of shrub forest. A mathematical model is established by converting qualitative data to quantitative data to provide the independent variables; biomass data is the dependent variable. Quantitative tables for nine shrub species are obtained: Caragana intermediate, C korshinskii, Hedysarum scoparium, H. laeve, Salix psammophila, Amorpha fruticosa, Hippophae rhamnoides, Artemisias phaerocephala, A. ordosica. On the bases of these tables, the biomass of various shrubs growing in the same type of area can be evaluated; shrub species can then be matched to suitable sites. The crown breadth and height of shrubs reflect the biomass yield above ground. A multiple regression mathematical model can be established, which provides a simple method for
evaluating the shrub biomass in forestland.
