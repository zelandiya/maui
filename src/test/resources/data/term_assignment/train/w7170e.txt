<title>Issues and Opportunities in the Evolution of Private Forestry and Forestry Extension in Several Countries with Economies in Transition in Central and Eastern Europe</title>
<section>1</section>
Preface
The nations of Eastern Europe have a long and well-recognized history and traditions of forestry practices, particularly in the development of silvicultural and management techniques for large royal or government forest estates. These forest estates, in many countries, were often significantly increased shortly after World War II as the result of nationalization.
Recently, however, many countries of Eastern Europe are undergoing or have undergone dramatic shifts in forest ownership patterns. Through processes of compensation, restitution and privatization, thousands of hectares of state forest land have been placed in the hands of private individuals. There has been a tremendous increase in the number of private forest owners, many with small and sometimes dispersed holdings and little background in forest management. Thus, one of the most affected sub-sectors may well be forestry extension, which changes fundamentally as a function of forest ownership. Extension for private owners, who by definition have a say in how their land is managed, differs from 'extension' for state lands where the government personnel often has direct authority to manage the forest estate. Forest management techniques developed for large government forest estates must therefore be revised, adapted, updated and communicated to private owners and new
approaches must be developed for small private owners. Appropriate organizations and associations of forest owners and farmers should be promoted to assure coordinated management and economies of scale. The commitment and participation of private owners in all phases of forest development and conservation must be assisted and developed. Small forest owners, often under economic pressure, are those most needing advice and assistance to manage their forests sustainably.
In addition, similar policy and tenure changes in the agriculture sector also imply a new role for forestry extension, especially in the areas of agroforestry and the conversion of marginal, degraded or abandoned agricultural lands into forests. These changes combined with changes in the political arena will even affect the remaining government forest estate where new levels of public participation and involvement may be required.
Many of the countries in Eastern Europe are facing the same challenges in forestry extension. This publication attempts to address this situation by documenting and analysing recent changes in forest ownership patterns, discussing the needs of and identifying possible approaches for, forestry extension in the region. It is based on a survey of nine countries, four country profiles written by national experts, country visits by an expert from the region and meetings and interactions with resource persons from the area. While a variety of forms of forest ownership exist, such as communal management, this document deals mainly with private forestry sensu stricto.
Many people have contributed to this work - both from inside FAO and from the countries concerned. Those who wrote country profiles are indicated under the respective sections. Tamas Marghescu visited and wrote country profiles for several countries. He also collaborated with Jon Anderson, Forestry Extension Officer, FAO, on the regional overview. Mr. Anderson initiated the work and edited much of the volume. Additional editing and formatting was done by Kathryn Carlisle. Many other resource persons, too numerous to mention individually - particularly those from the countries themselves who commented frankly on an initial draft - deserve recognition here. Within FAO special mention needs to be given to Jean Clement, Marc de Montalembert and Lennart Ljungman for suggestions and contributions.
This book, while dealing with a complex and on-going process, should be useful to a broad range of foresters, extensionists, planners, and policy and decision makers, and to those involved in international cooperation concerned with this region. It is hoped that it will contribute concretely to sustainable forest management in the region.

Introduction and Methods
Since the early 1990s, many nations around the world, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), have embarked on a process of transformation or transition of their economies from central planning to a more market orientation. This transition is not simply economic but affects also the political and social spheres. These changes are having, and will continue to have, important impacts on virtually all areas of life in these nations. Forestry is not an exception.
Many countries in the region went through varying degrees of nationalization of private property, including forest land, in the years following World War II. Much of the means of production (labor, land and capital) came under state ownership and control in centrally planned economies. However, since the early 1990s a reverse trend is apparent, marked by privatization, a reduction of state influence and a shift towards a market economy and political pluralism.
Privatization as used here encompasses three main processes:
 The selling (or privatization) of former state property (enterprises, real estate) to non-state entities.
 The restitution of nationalized or collectivized private property to their former owners.
 The transfer of state property to private concerns in order to satisfy demands made on the state mainly as compensation for the previous nationalization (expropriation) and collectivization of private property.
Governments in the countries in transition of CEE have often established specialized ministries and/or agencies to implement privatization with the secondary objective of utilizing the income from privatization for investments urgently needed in the general transformation process of the national economy.
The goal of much of the economic liberisation has been to stimulate economic growth and improve standards of living. However, the transition has resulted in some economic hardships, hopefully temporary, including the bankruptcy of certain industries, unemployment, a decrease in production, inflation, currency devaluation, reduced real income (especially in public employment and pension schemes), the development of trade deficits in areas previously self-sufficient, and the growth of the 'black economy'. There are fears that the new economic environment may be increasing the hardship and suffering on the part of a large portion of the population who are therefore looking for short term economic gains. However, in some countries, the economic forecasts suggest improving conditions for most people.
Methods
A survey of the status of private forestry and forestry extension in several CEE countries was conducted as a first step to identifying needs, trends and in developing appropriate capacities for forestry extension. Initially, countries were contacted as a result of their participation in the FAO Committee on Forestry (COFO) Meeting of March, 1995. Later, other countries became interested in participating and provided data. It should be noted that the countries covered in this report were not necessarily chosen to reflect a range of bio-physical or socio-economic conditions and be a 'representative sample'. However it is felt that their experience is of interest to a range of other countries in the area and outside.
A simple questionnaire (see Annex 1) was designed and sent to officials responsible for forestry in the selected countries. The questionnaire contained a request for information on:
 total forest area and percent of forest area;
 forest ownership patterns before the year 1985;
 forest ownership pattern in 1995;
 planned forest ownership pattern (policy statement);
 number of private forest owners per private forest property size classes;
 total area of private forest property per different size classes;
 existence of forestry extension mechanisms;
 types of government support for forestry extension;
 institutional arrangements for forestry extension;
 existence of forest owners' associations or groups;
 types and adequacy of training of forestry extension personnel;
 main problems associated with forestry extension; and
 identification of needs in relation to forestry extension.
Completed questionnaires were received from nine countries (Armenia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia). In addition, a number of authors were commissioned to provide more detailed information in the form of country papers. Country papers have been prepared for Armenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia (See Table 1). The reports of the FAO/World Bank Investment Center were also consulted.

Forest resources of countries in Central and Eastern Europe
Forest cover in CEE countries is diverse. Countries with a relatively high percentage of forest cover are Croatia (44%), Latvia (44%), Estonia (48%), Slovenia (54%) and Slovakia (41%). Countries with relatively low percentage of forest cover include Armenia (12%), Republic of Moldova (9%) and Ukraine (15%). According to the 'FAO Forest Resource Assessment, 1990' (FAO, 1995), the average forest cover for Europe is 27% (figures of Belarus, Ukraine and other former USSR not included in calculation).

*forest land area
** covered in this study
Average standing volume varies between 79 m/ha in Albania (including coppice and shrub forest) and 217 m/ha in former Czechoslovakia (Bemmann, 1995).
Average annual increment figures vary between 1 m/ha in Albania (this figure increases if only high forest areas are calculated) and 8 m/ha in former Czechoslovakia (Bemmann, 1995).
The per caput forest area in CEE varies widely from country to country. It is 0.09 ha/caput in the Republic of Moldova and 1 ha/caput in Estonia/Russian Federation: 5 ha per caput (FAO, 1995).
Forests in the region are negatively affected by factors such as air pollution, pest outbreaks and radioactivity. The forest area most damaged is the 'Black Triangle' (border triangle of three countries - Germany, Czech Republic and Poland). In Hungary and Romania, the 'oak decline' is taking its toll. It is believed to be connected to coppice management and stress factors (long drought periods in combination with frost), reducing the vitality of oaks, making them susceptible to secondary diseases caused by fungi and insects. In eastern Poland and Lithuania, large forest tracks of spruce and pine are affected by infestation cycles of Lymantria monchana, Pityogenes chalcographus and other insects, requiring large-scale, pest-management operations.
For a number of reasons, it is difficult to estimate the contribution of the forestry sector to the national economy of these, or any countries. Information is lacking or difficult to analyze and compare in many areas. However, it is estimated that forest products contributed 7% to the gross domestic product (GDP) of former Czechoslovakia (probably among the highest in Europe), 5% to Romania, 4% to Poland and 2% to Hungary. In comparison, forest products contribute 1% to the GDP of France and 7% to Finland. These figures are probably conservative since they consider only roundwood product values (SOFO, 1995). In many of the countries, environmental, hunting, recreational and other values are also important.
Forest industry
State-owned, forest-industry enterprises in the centrally-planned, economic environment were often linked to state-owned forest enterprises in a vertically integrated organization. Forest enterprises sold wood for set prices or internally transferred raw material free of charge to forest-industry enterprises. In most countries of the region, forest-industry enterprises have now been privatized to some extent. In order to modernize their technology and compete under the new market conditions, enterprises needed capital. This led to the development of joint ventures with foreign investors. Some outdated enterprises closed down completely. Countries where vertically organized, combined forest/forest industry enterprises continued to operate under state ownership, the economic operation of resource management was, at least through bookkeeping, separated from the forest industry unit. The survival of state-owned forest industry will be ensured only through profits due to adequate
management, marketing and continuous investment in competitive technology. Some forest-industry plants continue to work with their present, outdated technology, since relatively low labor costs provide a profit margin. Reluctance to invest in new technology is attributed to unfavorable loan conditions, posing too high a risk. Especially in the beginning of the transition period, forest and forestry industry enterprises were flooded by Western experts and companies seeking to sell their services and technology. 'In many countries, the privatization of forest industry is occurring in isolation from forestry. Increasing the capacity of the forest industries will increase the demand for raw material and, in the face of economic recession, governments (still the major forest owners) may be tempted to draw excessively on forest resources to obtain badly needed capital for investment' (Marghescu, 1994).
Marketing and trade of wood and wood products
With the collapse of the economic union of centrally planned countries of CEE (COMECON), previous export possibilities for semi-finished and finished wood products to the former Soviet Union were, to a large extent, terminated. Also largely terminated were exports of logs from the former Soviet Union to these countries. The few exports to Western Europe, which had been administered by the state foreign trade organizations, only served the purpose of hard currency supply. The exported semi-finished and finished products mainly belonged to the low-price and low-quality range. In 1989, imports of wood products from Eastern Europe to countries such as the Federal Republic of Germany accounted for only 9% of total imports and Germany only exported 2% of its total exports to COMECON countries. The exports to the East were disrupted and CEE countries had to orient themselves in a western direction to develop new export markets. In 1991 and 1992, a large number of suppliers from the
East were trying to step into the Western market with timber and cut wood. However, their expectations were sometimes unrealistic in terms of quality, measurements and supply conditions (Schweinle, 1992). Marketing and market intelligence operations are often activities carried out by the different companies in complete isolation from each other. In many countries of the region there is no central, marketing-information organization to inform companies on international market developments. CEE countries have adjusted standards according to Western partners' in terms of reliable and correct product grading. However, improvements could still be made in this field. There are even reports on organized crime influences in the forest-industry sector in some countries (Neumann and Matysiak, 1996).
Forestry education
Technical and higher forestry education in the CEE countries has traditionally been of a high standard in the biological sciences. The transition process, however, demanded fundamental curriculum changes. The main changes are taking place in the subject areas of forestry economics and forest policy, since these were previously influenced by socialist ideologies. The need for a new subject area (forestry extension) is apparent in connection with the evolving private forest sector. Another radical change took place in the area of compulsory language education. Previously, Russian was compulsory. Today students are able to select between different languages, including English, German and French. The libraries of most forestry education institutions, however, still contain much outdated literature. New textbooks and Western periodicals are scarce due to financial restrictions. Supplementary communication channels (electronic distance learning and Internet) could ease the
problem. The adjustment of teaching staff to the new situation will take time - in some cases a full generation. Some institutions are closely cooperating with partner institutions in the West. The exchange of teaching staff, especially in the area of forestry economics and forest policy, is a priority. In 1994, the Technical University of Dresden, Germany (former East Germany) founded a chair for Forestry and Wood Industries of Eastern Europe to support European integration throughout the transition process in Eastern Europe (Bemmann, 1995).
Forestry research
Forestry research institutions in most CEE countries are presently engaged in crisis management. Prior to the economic and political changes, forestry research institutions were an integral part of central planning and research subjects had to conform to certain political and economic objectives. Research was almost exclusively financed from state budget resources. With transition process and increasingly scarce state resources, research institution personnel have often been diminished. Radically trimmed institutions often found themselves unable to keep up important, long- and medium-term projects initiated prior to cutbacks. In addition, research topics were scientific and technical in nature, without anticipating the socio-economic needs of the merging class of private owners in forestry and farming. The practical links between research, education and extension were not well developed.
Management of the institutions has had considerable difficulties adapting to a new economic environment. Research has to be marketed and sold, short-term economic impact must be considered, national and international competition for scarce resources must be faced and consumers of research results who are willing to share costs are needed. In the more practical environment, applied research seems to be gaining importance compared to basic research. The low salary of researchers leads partly to the dispersion of research personnel to better paid jobs and to the search for supplemental occupations. Such a state of affairs leads to a further reduction of effective time devoted to research (Krott, 1996). The democratization in CEE countries has opened up new dimensions for international forestry-research cooperation and for the exchange of data and information.
Public participation
Political liberalization and democratization in CEE and, almost simultaneously, UNCED (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) in Rio in 1992, led to the development and growth of national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), with environmental concerns. WWF (Worldwide Fund for Nature) and IUCN (The World Conservation Union) established a network of country offices in the CEE. Government administrations, including the state authorities for forestry, must now consider the viewpoints of NGOs, representing opinions with certain public support, in decision-making processes. The relatively restricted community of forestry professionals in the past was self enclosed and only occasionally received political directives from outside. Professional problems were solved inside the circle, which now has to open up to wider public discussions. Overall, the public is demanding more information and a greater role in decision making in forestry. The
forestry sector is continuously increasing public relations to gain support in the struggle for state budgetary support. Evolving and sometimes substantial private forest ownership further contributes to the opening of the once exclusive forestry sector. As much as NGOs, the private forestry sector, especially where owners are well organized, is fulfilling a watchdog function, scrutinizing the steps of forestry administrations and of state forest management organizations. Local organizations are being formed or revived that have great interest in the forestry debate.
Forest policy and legislation
The changes taking place in the CEE countries have required a renewal and revision of the policy and legislation frameworks in all sectors - an enormous task. For forestry legislation and policies, UNCED (1992) and subsequent follow-up action led to the upsurge of environmental protection, effecting the forestry sector.
Almost all CEE countries have formulated new forest laws in the past five years such as the Czech Republic (Principles of the State Forest Policy, 1994), Slovakia (State Forest Policy, 1995) and Slovenia (Forestry Development Programme of Slovenia, 1996) (see Table 7). Poland and Latvia, were planning to complete forest policies in 1996.
New forestry legislation is dealing with the management regulations for both state and private forest ownership. Sustainability is understood not only as the sustained production of wood, but comprises the sustainability of the entire forest ecosystem with its multiple functions (environmental, social and economic) and processes. Silvicultural and forest management practices are increasingly guided towards close-to-nature forestry in Slovenia in particular. Environmental and nature protection is receiving more attention, which leads, at least in the medium term, to restrictions of economically-oriented forest management.

Policy debates and the re-opening of questions about forest legislation and policy are not unique to the CEE. Western European countries are also in the process of adapting their forest policies in the light of international agreements following UNCED, and there is a move towards harmonization of national policies in Europe. One important issue in forest policies of most CEE countries is afforestation. Afforestation is regarded as a viable solution to utilize low-productivity of agricultural land and wasteland more effectively. Some countries are considering or have started to implement large-scale forestation programmes to combat rising rural unemployment. While CEE countries must move ahead with the sound formulation and implementation of their own forest policies and legislation, this will eventually have to, at least partially, reflect agreements and negotiations at the regional and international levels.

Forest Ownership Patterns
Total forest area privately owned
Size of private holdings
In the countries of CEE formerly under centrally planned economies, forest resources and forest industries were owned or controlled and managed by the State for more than four decades. With the political change, the countries also began examining the privatization possibilities in the forest sector. The question of restitution of forest resources to former owners and the compensation of demands (related to losses through expropriation in the late 1940s) with forest property was and remains a hot political issue. Most forest administrations, due to lack of political lobby, had to give in to political pressure and rapidly, substantial forest resources became privately owned, sometimes too fast to avoid predictable problems, such as the fragmentation of the forest resource in small private holdings.
Most CEE countries have set a policy imposing an upper limit to the privatization of forest resources. Substantial forest resources, it is felt, have to remain state property to secure the provision of social and environmental services of forest resources on a sustainable basis. They are also to be a shining example for private forest owners. Nevertheless, some countries in CEE do not have the economic resources to adequately finance state forestry. Therefore, state forest administrations are being reformed, introducing corporate structures and mechanisms to raise efficiency. In many countries, state forest enterprises are selling or privatizing their equipment for harvesting, transport, forest road construction and maintenance operations to former employees, who then work as contractors for the enterprise. A problem which frequently occurs is that these contractors usually are not able to carry out necessary modernization of their equipment due to the lack of capital. There
is widespread neglect of safety rules, ergonomic/health related issues and adequate training of the work force. An overly profit-oriented structure could also lead to neglect of the social and environmental aspects of forestry and compromise sustainability.
The forest ownership pattern of the countries under review was limited, with the exception of Poland and Slovenia, to two forms of ownership - state-owned forest and forests owned by collective farms. After World War II, large-and medium-sized forest property (mainly > 25 ha) had been nationalized in Poland. Small private property (17% of all forests in Poland), however, continued to exist formally, even though the State took control of its management. In Slovenia, 20% of private forests (large estates) were nationalized after World War II, however, two-thirds of Slovenian forests were still privately owned during the socialist period. The private forest owners had to sell their timber to the State and had to eventually form cooperatives, which were incorporated into forest management enterprises in charge of managing all Slovenian forests. In the late 1980s, the system collapsed and farmers started to sell timber on their own. In the other countries, expropriated forests
were transformed into state-owned forests, or were attached to collective farms together with nationalized, agricultural land.
With the radical political changes, privatization and restitution became the foremost important agenda items in the transition process. Agencies, institutions and even ministries were created to administer and manage the process. Policies, laws and implementation guidelines were formulated. Forestry professionals were cognisant of the risks of forest privatization without a protective framework (such as a forestry extension system) to ensure the sustainable management of private forest property. Some countries surveyed, started with the privatization to various degrees, seemingly without such a framework.
Total forest area privately owned
Slovenia is presently the country with the highest share of private forests (68%). The share of private forests in Poland and Slovenia is not the result of privatization, since these private forests already existed in the socialist period. In Romania, in 1946, 30% of the forest resources were privately owned and 46% of all forests belonged to the communities. At present a uniform area of 1 ha of forest is being returned to the former private forest owners, which accounts for around 6% of the total forest area in the country. In Armenia, agricultural land is being privatized, but no forest land. Some of the privatized agricultural land will be converted to forest land use in the future through forestation. Private farmers may benefit from extension for agroforestry and soil/water conservation. In Latvia, the restitution process is implemented in two stages - the land use right is transferred and then the full acknowledgment of land property rights follows. In 1991, the
declared Lithuanian policy was to restrict the size of private forest estates to maximum 10 ha, which was later modified to maximum 25 ha and no limitations in size in the southeastern part of the country. Above examples show, that there is a wide variation in the method and extent of forest land privatization in the region.
As compared to the forest ownership pattern in 1995, the countries surveyed (with the exception of Armenia and Romania) wish to increase the share of private forest ownership in the future (see Table 5). The Czech Republic by 8%, Poland by about 6%, Latvia by almost 19%, Lithuania by 21%, Slovakia by 7% and Slovenia with already 68% by 12% to reach a total share of 80% of private forests. Croatia and Armenia are not in a position to give definitive indications on policy directions in relation to privatization of existing forest resources, however, for Armenia it is expected that a private forest sector will develop in future through the forestation of privatized agricultural land. Hungary plans to increase private forests to 39% from 16% in 1995 and 1% in 1985. According to the information provided by Romania, the present share of private forests (6%) should be decreased to only 5% in the future. At the same time, the forestation of low-productive agricultural land is
encouraged, which contradicts the intended decrease of private forest property. Parliamentary elections held in Romania in 1996, brought a change in government, through which the ruling socialists were replaced by a liberal/conservative coalition. This might result in changes in the privatization and restitution policies (See Annexes 2, 3 and 4 for details on forest ownership patterns).

It is expected that private forest ownership will increase since a number of countries surveyed are already engaged in or plan to implement national afforestation programmes. Countries aim to reduce their low-productive agricultural areas, for which afforestation is a viable solution. In some countries, such as Latvia, abandoned agricultural land of collective farms or restituted, but not cultivated, agricultural land is turning into forest land through natural regeneration and regrowth.
For the countries in the study the projected figures for forest land to be privately held varies from 5% (Romania) to 80% (Slovenia) (See Tables 5 and 6). For the other countries providing data the average projected private forest ownership is 30%. For comparison, private forests amount to 71% of the forest area in France and 45% in the former Federal Republic of Germany (Grayson, 1993).

Graph 2: Percentage of forest land publicly held by year
Size of private holdings
Table 7 gives an estimate of private forest owners per forest property size class. In the eight countries for which some data were available (Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovenia), the overwhelming majority (over 90%) of private forest owners have a property size under 5 ha. In Croatia, Poland and Romania, 100% of forest owners fall under that property size class. In Slovenia the figure is almost 90%, in the Czech Republic it is around 75%. The data for Lithuania is not sufficient to give a clear indication of the situation. Most likely there are also private properties in Lithuania which belong to the under 5 ha size category. Information is not available on whether the property of individual owners is contiguous or divided in parts at different locations. In Lithuania, the authorities are trying to consolidate and reduce the fragmented structure of individual private forest property. Consolidation through owners concentrating their
properties in one geographical location by exchanging forest properties among each other is expected in most countries once the restitution process is completed.

In most of the countries there are temporary restrictions for selling restituted land, especially to foreigners. However, it appears that there is an informal market for privatized forest land with illegal or unofficial trading. This development has reached such a magnitude in some countries that legal action against these tendencies could lead to the collapse of the entire restitution scheme and could result to instability of the transition process as a whole. Therefore, these unofficial transactions might be legalized, in some form, in the future. This and the legal real estate business, will lead to a certain consolidation of private forest property and to a reduction of the number of forest owners in relation to the same, present private forest area. An increase of the number of forest owners and fragmentation tendencies of private forest property could be the result of real inheritance systems in a given country, meaning that a 5 ha forest property could be divided
among the five children of the deceased owner to equal parts in five 1 ha properties.

 Calculated average property size between 6-7 ha
Table 8 shows that in the countries which provided data, over 50 percent of private forests belongs to the property size class of less than 5 ha. In Croatia, Romania and Poland, 100% of the private forest area belongs to this size category. In Slovakia, 60% of total private forest area belongs to forest estates larger than 100 ha, in the Czech Republic it is more than 30%. This different pattern is connected to the restitution and privatization policies, in particular to the base year of restitution claims, which differs from country to country. Expropriation in the past, had often been conducted in phases, nationalizing first the large private estates and later the smaller properties. Through the above described ongoing, unofficial market and the legal real estate business, it is expected that a certain accumulation of forest property by individuals with capital is taking place, which will increase the number of owners and the forest area of the higher size categories.
For comparison, in France, 75% of the area in private ownership is in tracts larger than 4 ha. In the former Federal Republic of Germany, 58% of the private forest holdings are under 50 ha (2% under 1 ha) and 15% over 1000 ha. In Sweden 87% of forests that are privately owned are in holdings of 25 ha or more (Grayson, 1993).
As a rough but probably conservative estimate, in the countries covered by this report between 1985 and 1995, there are probably well over 1 000 000 new forest land owners. The amount of forest concerned is well over 2 000 000 ha, more than the total forest area of Hungary or Lithuania. The average private holding is well under 5 ha.
Overall the structure of private forest ownership in many places in the CEE does not appear favorable for sustainable and efficient forest management. Forest tracts divided in many small individual properties require the association of forest owners to form larger management units irrespective of individual property boundaries. However, there are psychological barriers with new forest owners, because association brings up memories of expropriation and forced collectivization.

Main constraints encountered in forestry extension
Forestry extension needs identified by the CEE
Forestry extension and other land ownership patterns
The management of private forests is influenced by three main sets of factors; the characteristics of the owner, the characteristics of the forest stand itself, and the external constraints and opportunities. The characteristics of the owner include his/her overall financial situation and the place of forestry within this situation, age, family status, residence, etc. The characteristics of the forest stand include its size, distribution, structure, productivity, composition, history, etc. In terms of external constraints and opportunities are the general economic situation, the wood and non-wood forest product markets, existence of incentives and subsidies, etc. Important in the last set of influences includes the professional environment, including access to, and the quality of, extension services, government and others. (Normandin, 1987) It is important the extension take these three sets of influences into consideration if it hopes to effect private forest management.
Extension, of course, exists in a variety of forms. Different situations have dictated different extension strategies. Axinn (1988), for example, discusses eight different approaches including:
 the general approach;
 the commodity specialized approach;
 the training and visit approach;
 the participatory extension approach;
 the project approach;
 the farming systems approach;
 the cost-sharing approach; and
 the educational institution approach.
Each of these approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. These approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive in a particular country, neither are they a complete description of the approaches that exist. In many cases extension systems have to be built up from the local situation, taking inspiration and learning lessons from the other approaches that have been developed but not applying them as a 'perfect model'.
The extension strategy should match the local situation (including characteristics of the owner and the external environment as well as appropriate to the forest stand itself) and the extension structure should be appropriate for the selected strategy (FAO, 1986). The extension strategy should not necessarily be driven by an existing structure or government department which may have developed a strategy for another tenure regime (state-owned forests), the organizational mix should reflect the most appropriate strategy. It is often useful to think first about extension as a 'bundle' of functions rather than as an institution (Anderson and Farrington, 1995). These functions might include training, information, technical advice, organization, marketing, credit and incentives, forest management planning, monitoring and evaluation as well as others. Thus it becomes clear that a number of different institutions might be (or should be) involved in extension to varying degrees and
carry out slight different functions. It is difficult for a single institution to carry out all the functions required for promoting sustainable forest management. These different organizations, such as farmers' groups, forest owners' associations, non-governmental organizations, universities, foundations, private companies and so on; may complement the work of the government and provide essential services. They may need strengthening to fulfill some extension functions effectively and efficiently, but they may be critical players.
In situations where the state owns and directly manages the national forest estate, a type of 'command and control' extension strategy may be implemented and government institutions organized hierarchically or in a semi-military type of structure. However the same strategy and structure may not be appropriate if there are significant numbers of private forest owners with rights to decision-making on their lands. As the local situation changes, as it has been in many places in the CEE, it is necessary to develop or rethink extension strategies and structures.
Institutional responsibility for forestry extension
Presently the institutional responsibility for the enforcement and the monitoring of forestry laws and regulations in connection with forestry extension lies with the Ministries in charge of forestry in all countries surveyed (see Table 9).

At the field level, the institutional responsibility for forestry extension is mostly with the regional and local state forestry administration (see Table 10).
In Poland, the responsibility is assigned to the provincial governors, who, however, do not have the required professional capacities. The governors, therefore, have the possibility to entrust the field offices of the state forest administration with the task of forestry extension.
In Latvia, discussions are being held to establish a system for forestry extension, combining private forestry extension consultancy services and a forestry extension service as a specialized unit of the State Forest Service.
In Slovakia, the responsibility for forestry extension on the field level seems to be divided between three actors. The Forest Project Office (Forest Management Bureau) is responsible for the preparation and enforcement (monitoring) of forest management plans in both private and state forests. The Professional Forest Managers seem to be private forestry professionals, who advise private forest owners and the Forest Offices as part of the state forest administration are probably in charge for mainly law enforcement.
There has been no indication for plans to institutionally place forestry extension within existing agricultural extension services.
In France, there are several sources of extension for private owners. This is an arrangement where several different institutions, which may have different main functions, have various roles and degrees of involvement in forestry extension. It also demonstrates approaches that emphasis:
 decentralization and regionalization;
 economic aspects and profitability;
 the commitment, participation and level of control of private forest owners; and
 the importance of management plans and the process of their approval.
Extension is mainly provided by 17 Regional Centres of Forest Ownership (CRPF - Centres Regionaux de la Propriete Forestiere). The 17 CRPF are public organizations administered by elected representatives of private forest owners, under the guidance of the administration. They have been legally entrusted with the task of developing and guiding the forest management and production of private owners. They do this by assisting in the organization and cooperative action of private owners for both forest management and production, by providing extension services about silvicultural, marketing and management methods, by formulating regional guidelines and by assisting in the preparation of forest management plans complying with the regional guidelines. These plans are approved by the CRPF under the control of the decentralized services of the Ministry of Agriculture. The 17 CRPFs employ a total of 256 people including 72 engineers and 122 forest technicians. At the department level
the private sector and private owners are represented by Departmental Professional Committees. The National Association of CRPF (ANCRPF) and the National Professional Committee of Private Forestry are national federations representing the private owners and private sector in the High National Forest Council in which the administration, the private industry and NGOs are also represented.
Extension is also provided by the Forest Development Institute (IDF). The IDF was set up in 1960 by private forest owners to undertake forest development programmes as well as conduct applied research and training/extension on forests, forest products, forestation of denuded lands, plantations and multiple use of trees in both rural and urban environment. It organizes training programmes and produces major publications containing technical information. It receives substantial financial aid from the National Association for Agricultural Development (ANDA), like all the national professional centers in the agricultural sector. In two of France's largest forested regions, two organizations undertake comparable assignments at the local level: the Center for Forest Productivity in Aquitaine (CPFA) and the Federation of Forestry Information and Education Center of Eastern France (FVFE).
The majority of the 90 departmental Chambers of Agriculture also employ forest technicians who carry out forest development programmes and help the forest cooperatives and forest owners by providing extension services and advice.
Finally there are numerous private forestry consultants who provide advice and assistance on a fee basis.

Training of private and/or communal forest owners is an essential task to ensure proper, sustainable forest management in private and communal forests. With the exception of Croatia, Poland and Slovenia, where private forest ownership existed during the period of central planning, there is a new or renewed group of private forest owners. Many owners have had no exposure to forestry before and often they are city dwellers far away from their properties. In the time of economic hardship new private forest owners may draw upon their forests in an unsustainable manner to gain needed income for securing sometimes even the bare survival of their families. In Western Europe, private forestry has a long-standing tradition, associated with a system for the education of private forest owners. In Western Europe, as elsewhere, private forests can be multi-functional and include a range of social objectives from recreation to fuelwood and provide capital for certain investments.
Depending on the objectives of the owners, training priorities and the content of training in CEE countries would be somewhat different than Western Europe. Training programmes and methodologies will need modification and adaptation by local experts to local conditions, objectives and practices.
Training of private forest owners has to deal in the first place with information dissemination. The owners have to be made aware of restrictions (laws, regulations, etc.) and opportunities in relation to their properties and they should be informed about government policies and government incentives in relation to private forestry. Simple knowledge of forest management and marketing is another important area. Forestry work, especially cutting timber by chainsaws can be dangerous. Private forest owners, who wish to carry out forest work in their forests themselves must be taught working techniques and safety rules. With the exception of Slovenia and the Czech Republic, the countries surveyed have not yet dealt with the training private forest owners as a continous task, since beside the need of regular refresher courses, always new trainees appear through generation changes and eventually through the selling of properties.

*Opinion based on country paper by Marghescu, 1995
Forestry extension personnel in Slovenia, who are considered to have an inadequate level of training, has probably one of the best training standards in the Region. It is felt that the judgment made by Latvia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Romania is describing the training standards of forestry extension personnel in general forestry subjects. Forestry extension, however, requires more than just a traditional forestry education. For more than four decades, foresters were a small professional circle, dealing almost exclusively with centrally planned and directed forestry affairs. With the developing private forest sector, a large number of new actors are joining the forestry scene, which are in need of professional assistance. To render this professional assistance, foresters need to develop their communication skills and require at least an introduction to tools of extension developed by social sciences. Foresters as unique expert authorities and police-like officers
enforcing laws and regulations may be inappropriate when faced with private forest owners and a more decentralized and democratic situation. The spirit and concept of participation have to enter the minds of foresters assigned with extension duties. The training of personnel presently assigned to forestry extension duties is one task, which probably could be tackled with a series of training courses. The second task is the incorporation of forestry extension as a subject into the curricula of forestry faculties and technical forestry schools. Administrations in charge of forestry extension have to provide career development possibilities for forestry extension personnel, so working in forestry extension becomes attractive. Frequently, forestry extension is mistaken with the term and field of public relations.
Government support for forestry extension
The survey requested the participating countries to specify the form of government support given to private forest owners.

*Preparation of management plans
Latvia was not, at least until the completion of the questionnaire, supporting private forest owners at all. However, in 1996, the Ministry of Agriculture supported the Forest Owners' Association through providing training facilities, office space and paying for the salary of the Association's president. In Lithuania, state forest enterprise personnel carries out extension work, mainly limited to law monitoring and enforcement. The preparation of management plans is partly supported, since necessary field surveys are financed by the state and only the actual plan preparation has to be paid by the private forest owner. In Romania, local management plans are state funded. Afforestation is partly financed by the state budget or a special fund for the afforestation of degraded or low-productive land. The state forestry administration provides free services in the prevention and fighting of forest pests. In the case of natural disasters, the state forestry administration will
provide technical assistance and seedlings free of charge for reforestation. In Poland, the state forest administration delegated by the provincial governors provides extension services, mainly supervision. Forest management plans for private forests are prepared with state funding. Other support includes tax exemptions for forests less than 40 years old, occasional marketing for the sale of timber, and seedlings provided free of charge for afforestation (not yet for reforestation). In Slovenia, the Slovenian Forest Service is providing the extension personnel with government funding. Besides the personnel, the government is paying subsidies for forest regeneration, forest tending, measures against fires, pests and game, for the maintenance of wildlife habitats, maintenance of forest roads and investments such as forest road construction, forestation, etc. There was no more specific information available on forms of government support for private forest owners in Slovakia
and the Czech Republic.
Organization of private forest owners
Today, a private forest sector is appearing at an unprecedented speed. The number of new forest owners is growing daily, confronting governments with the challange to ensure sustainable forest management in all forests, both private and state-owned. In countries with a long tradition of private forestry, a government supported forestry extension system provides assistance in the form of technical, professional advice, information, incentives, etc.

Slovenia
There is one association with very limited number of members. It represents the interests of expropriated former owners. 4% of forest owners are organized in so called Machine Circles, but a lot of informal, not registered cooperation exists among neighbors.
Forest owners' associations are in the interest of governments as platforms for efficient forestry extension. Forestry associations are beneficial to forest owners themselves. Expensive equipment for forest work could be bought by the associations to be shared among members, reducing the fix-cost burden of individual owners. Higher sale prices could be achieved for wood products through joint marketing and through bulk orders, the expenditures for seedlings needed for reforestation and afforestation could be lowered. Through joint development of infrastructure for forestry (e.g. road construction), the structural disadvantages of small forest properties could be further reduced.
A formal requirement to form management associations as a precondition for restitution is a technique to encourage the formation of such groups. However, this could result in lawsuits, since restituted owners might claim injust restrictions in the free use of their private property. Democratic governments could develop incentive packages, which are attractive enough for forest owners to voluntarily form associations.
Existing forest owners' associations in the Czech Republic, Latvia and Lithuania are characteristically umbrella organizations, underlined by low membership. Their objective is to represent the interests of private forest owners at the national and political levels. Formal associations or groups on the local level, with the objective of facilitating practical forest management, are rare. In Slovenia, however, informal cooperation among neighboring forest owners is common. The Slovak Private Forest Owners' Association has 670 collective and 1 700 individual members, who represent 78% of the total forest area restituted. The Forest Owners' Association in Latvia is attempting to develop a private forestry extension service by training and registering forestry extension consultants in the absence of a forestry extension service in the state forest administration.
In comparison, there are several different types of organizations in France. In one case, private forest owners (and operators) freely associate in formal or informal groups to increase the effectiveness and efficiencies of management for the common economic good of its members and have undertaken such activities as grouped wood sales and replanting. This is the largest kind. In another case, where a private company is formed, the individual owner forfeits his ownership rights. One of the main motivations for small holders for this type of organization is for the consolidation of family holdings for tax purposes. Another form of cooperative requires that management decisions made by a majority of members must be adopted by all members. Few of these exist.
Tables 15 and 16 present examples of different types of associations or organizations that exist in Auvergne, France, where forest ownership size averages 2.3 ha. Groups exist for both forest management and for the consolidation of forest property. Brief descriptions of the respective advantages and disadvantages are presented (Despres, 1989). It is clear that a range of organizational options exist for forest owners in different situations and periods. As seen previously, in France one of extension functions is to promote groups where needed.

In the former Federal Republic of Germany forest cooperatives are fairly active. They exist partly because of a political will to keep a diverse mix of forest ownership patterns and to promote cooperation among owners. These voluntary cooperatives can play an important economic role for small owners and have lead to significant gains in economic benefit for small owners. Some associations receive government support and undertake fairly extensive training programmes for forest owners.
In Bavaria, the average forest size for private owners is about 2.7 ha in three lots. For corporate forests, the average size is 64 ha. Government extension services concentrate on the small forest owner since the corporate owners usually have their own staff. There are about 173 forest associations in Bavaria with approximately 114 000 members covering 23% of the forest owners and 66% of the non-state forest land. These associations receive financial support (40% of administrative and investment costs) because of political desire to overcome the disadvantages of fragmented ownership. Recently, there has been a move towards more selective support to forest associations and therefore demonstration on the part of the associations of commitment and effectiveness.
Main constraints encountered in forestry extension
Among the priority problems in connection with forestry extension, several countries referred to difficulties in convincing private forest owners to form associations (Slovenia, Czech Republic and Poland). Another problem identified is closely connected to the previous one and is related to communication barriers between forestry extensionists and private owners. Poland refers to a lack of interests from the side of private forest owners in receiving advice from the state forest administration, although this is free of charge. Slovenia states that foresters are not respected enough and some owners think that 'there are too many of them'. On the other side, foresters are accused for not having changed their relations towards the forest owners and for 'not being keen to play the role of true advisers'. Latvia and Poland are trying to find solutions to promote forestry extension itself, to increase the number of popular publications and to intensify the promotion of basic rules
for forest management in the mass media for forest owners. Romania is concerned about raising awareness and responsiveness among government authorities concerning acute problems of forestry and lists among others the insufficient information about forestry extension and a lack of experience with forestry extension as basic issues. Slovakia, Lithuania and Latvia are referring to difficulties in establishing the institutional framework and financing mechanisms for forestry extension in their countries. Poland and the Czech Republic complain about missing mechanisms to provide private forest owners with marketing information and direct marketing assistance for wood products. Croatia reports that the small size of holdings and low production as well as lack of clear legal status are constraints to forestry extension. Almost all countries, reported that the newly born private forest owners have limited knowledge about forestry matters.
The problem of a certain awareness and reaction of authorities to forestry sector constraints (Romania) may also be experienced in other countries. Throughout the transition process, the state forest sectors of most countries were undergoing harsh changes. One important task seems to follow the other: reorganization, policy formation, formulation of draft laws (forestry, nature conservation, hunting), lengthy discussions and negotiations, inter-sectorial power struggles, formulation of regulations, administering restitution, daily administration of the forestry structures and institutions, dealing with economic hardship of officers, etc. With all these priorities and tasks, private forestry risks becoming a lower priority area - 'the orphan of forestry'. Hardly any career development possibilities are opening up in forestry extension and the motivation of government officers to work in forestry extension is often low. Some forest owners are not so interested in having
forestry extension either, since they might benefit from an unclear situation.
Individual countries have solved certain problems, at least partly, although they are sometimes still considering approaches and strategies for certain crucial decisions. However, a holistic and participatory approach in planning, designing and implementing a comprehensive and multi-partner forestry extension system seems often to be lacking. Forestry extension systems, designed exclusively by government officials in somewhat theoretical terms, may give priority to implementing the ideas and policy of government administrations to 'supervise' and regulated the private forest sector. Its acceptance by the owners and managers and their adhesion and support might not be readily obtained. In developing an effective forestry extension system the needs and objectives of private forest owners should be clear and the active participation and consultation of forest owners (or their elected representatives) is required in all stages of the planning and implementation. Forest owners
must feel that the forestry extension system is 'theirs'.
The problems identified by individual countries are, in many cases, similar. Failures (providing valuable information) and successes in the development of system elements could serve as lessons learned for other countries. Regional cooperation of CEE countries in the development of their forestry extension systems would appear to be beneficial.
Forestry extension needs identified by the CEE
The lack of the private forestry sector for more than 40 years, and sometimes the almost total isolation from the developments taking place in other parts of the world, has lead to a shortage of information in the CEE countries about theoretical and practical progress in the field of forestry extension. Through the political changes, the information barrier is being eliminated.
The countries participating in the survey almost unanimously noted the need for the creation of a regional forum which would serve as an information clearinghouse and network, promote training and exchanges and catalyze studies through workshops, consultations and other techniques. This underlines the demand for information, the need to exchange information and perhaps the readiness for regional cooperation. The main objective of such a forum might be to provide the countries with assistance in the fields of forestry extension personnel training (6 countries showed interest: Armenia, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovenia) and institution building, forestry extension system development (six countries would consider this a need: Armenia, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovakia). It is likely that in addition to the countries who participated in the survey, other CEE countries in similar conditions would be interested to join a regional forum on forestry
extension.

Forestry extension and other land ownership patterns
This paper has focused on the increasing number of private owners of forest land in the area. However, the changes underway affect also other areas of land tenure which may also create needs for forestry extension. Although the increase in private forestry may be the impetus for increased emphasis on extension and outreach, the transition is liable to effect other areas of the forest departments traditional and newer roles. Two areas deserve mention.
The present study shows that large areas of forest lands remain and will remain in government or public ownership, implying a continuation of existing management structures, approaches and techniques for these areas. However, political and economic changes may require new or adapted forms of management of public lands. The public in general and local non-governmental groups may demand an increasingly large share in decisions about how this public forest land is managed. Government foresters working in this setting may come in increasing contact with users of forest reserves and with groups wishing to influence government forest policy and implementation. Changes in the political systems and increased decentralization will effect the remaining forest estate where new levels of public participation and involvement may be required. This will also require extension skills - especially in communication and negotiation - for many foresters involved in state forest management.
In addition state forest administrations and managers should be made aware of their important function as an example or point of reference for private forest owners. A double standard in forest management should be avoided, especially, if state forest managers are at the same time working as extensionists with private owners.
The ownership patterns of agricultural lands are also changing, moving towards more private ownership. This shift sometimes exceeds the trends in public/private ownership in forest land and is creating new opportunities and needs for forestry extension. The case study from Armenia clearly shows that even when forest land is not 'privatized', changes in the agricultural sector may imply a new role for forestry extension especially in the areas of agroforestry and the conversion of marginal degraded or abandoned agricultural lands into forests. In this area extension options which include agricultural extension services should be explored.

Issues and Opportunities
Private forestry
Forestry extension
The following attempts to lay out some major issues and opportunities facing forestry extension and related private forestry issues in the countries of CEE. These issues and opportunities do not constitute a private forestry or extension programme for any country. They are however issues that appear to be common to the development extension systems to face the changing patterns of forest ownership and socio-economic conditions.
Private forestry
The issue of scale. The size of some privatized holdings appear so small that owners may be reluctant to invest in their management or in improving their productivity. Thus the expected increases in investment as a result of privatization may not meet expectations. Small sizes also may discourage professional management since, at these scales, forestry will often only be a secondary occupational consideration.
Total forest area in private hands. It is difficult to generalize about the total area of private forest land that are appropriate for any country. However, projected figures for the countries studied are generally well below that of other Western European countries. This may effect the development of the secondary services (marketing, transformation, processing, planting, etc.) needed for a dynamic and productive forestry sector.
The issue of rights. Privatizing forest land implies transferring a series of rights to the owner. Privatization will not have the desired effects if overly onerous restrictions are subsequently placed on owners for forest management, e.g. if requirements for management plans approved by the government effectively mean that the government is managing or controlling the management of the forest land. If the public interest implies that restrictions must be placed on private management and use, compensation may have to be considered.
The rate of privatization. The process of privatization should be carefully reviewed, monitored and tracked in order to get good information on potential problems and opportunities. Indicators will have to be developed that include both socio-economic and bio-physical parameters. It will be useful to monitor the forest real estate market, both formal and informal.
'Corporate' or industrial private forest owners. In many countries much of the economic activity and benefit from forestry comes from larger corporate or industrial forest owners. These are owners that have significant holdings to manage and can therefore afford investments and efficiencies in management. Forestry is a main occupation if not the only occupation for these owners. Privatization in the CEE has not really addressed this potential group. Privatization of forest land to create this category of land manager might be considered along side of efforts to promote the consolidation of forest property and organize associations for forest management.
Forestry extension
General
Institutional issues
Technical and policy issues
Capacity building issues
Financial and economic issues
General
Forestry extension is needed. The numbers of new owners, the size of holdings, the lack of local organizations and economic pressures motivating short term gains underline the somewhat urgent need for extension systems that can help promote economical and sustainable forest management.
Forestry extension is happening in a range of settings. Some extension functions are happening all the time in different formal and informal settings. Forest owners talk to each other, emerging private sector organizations provide or sell goods and services and information; forestry and environmental NGOs have outreach programmes, etc. Part of government's role in extension may be to facilitate and catalyze these initiatives and not supplant them.
The importance of functions. A number of functions can be assigned to extension such as information, training, advice, credit, etc. An analysis of who is already performing these tasks and who is the most appropriate to do so, may help in deciding the eventual role for government in extension activities.
A systematic and integrated approach is needed. For private forestry to take off a range of interrelated criteria have to be met. Privatizing forests may give an incentive to greater investment but be constrained by lack of suitable 'technical packages' or credit. The incentives provided by clear ownership may be compromised by the need to get governmental approval for interventions and planning. Therefore it is necessary that a systematic approach be taken to extension and the extension environment to assure that forestry will be effective and efficient. Applying an integrated approach in the development of forestry extension systems means that one has to harmonize forest sector policy and objectives with those of other sectors. A forestry extensionist, while carrying out effective forestry extension has to have knowledge of trends, programmes and realities of other disciplines and be prepared to coordinate and facilitate.
Local extension end-users should participate in the development and implementation of extension systems. Local forest owners and forest sector workers can bring not only local knowledge to the development of an extension system but also commitment and resources. This can best happen if the nature of the extension system is negotiated and developed together with the local forest stake holders. For government departments responsible for forestry an additional benefit of participation may be the creation of a 'lobby' for forestry in general.
The identification of owners and their objectives. New private forest owners may have a range of objectives for their forest lands. Some objectives may be social and some may related to economic activities such as hunting in addition to the more typical forestry objectives. The objectives and characteristics of the owners influence extension and need to be clearly identified. A profile of each owner might be useful, containing at least information on the objective of the owner, his/her occupation, description of the property etc. Forest owner profiles could form the basis for a computerized database. Extension systems should continually reassess stakeholder objectives.
Adaptations for local conditions. Conditions vary between localities and therefore the emphasis and approach of extension should vary accordingly. This is another issue that underlines the importance of local participation in the development of extension systems. Examples from and lessons learnt in other countries can be very useful and certain successful elements of forestry extension systems can be reviewed, adapted and incorporated in the process of system development in CEE countries.
Institutional issues
While extension systems should be adapted to the local and national contexts there seems to be opportunities for productive exchanges at the regional or sub-regional level. In terms of a general approach to forestry, forest ownership and forest management, many of these countries have some structural similarities and are undergoing similar restructuring and privatization processes. This would seem to indicate that regional cooperation, especially in training and sharing of experience and ideas about forestry extension would have a great deal of benefit.
Multi-partner extension systems may be needed. Given the present circumstances it is clear that governments can not do everything. In an increasingly complex and diverse institutional environment, extension systems will have to take advantage of the relative strengths of each type of organization in developing an extension system. The state may have to take initial responsibility and become active in facilitating a forestry extension framework in the interest of the public to secure sustainable forest management in private forests. Eventually other partners will include local associations, agricultural extension services, private sector concerns, non-governmental organizations, universities and others.
Forming groups and associations to effectively and efficiently manage small holdings. In many cases new private owners have very small and diverse holdings. It may be difficult to promote sustainable forestry at this scale and, in any case, management and economies of scale will be very difficult to achieve. It is therefore necessary for owners to associate and coordinate management and the provision of inputs and other forestry activities. Given the experience in many of these countries with collective approaches to production there may be some hesitancy about associations or group formation. Approaches to group formation will have to be carefully developed and negotiated. Other countries have had positive experiences with groups of forest owners which could perhaps merit study.
Separating or combining extension and regulatory functions. Extension workers have to gain the trust of their clients and this might be difficult, if they at the same time are mandated to supervise them, approve plans and enforce regulatory measures. The issue of the separation or combination of regulatory and extension functions will have to be carefully considered.
Research and Extension. Research on private forestry will be needed. Forestry extension needs close links to forestry research in order to communicate research results to the private forest owners and to inform forestry research institutions about the research needs and results of private forestry. The close relation between forestry extension and forestry research is also necessary to form extension dialogue that is timely and scientifically sound. The state, associations of smaller private forest properties and larger private forest estates as well as other may have an interest in financing research on private forestry issues.
Technical and policy issues
Silvicultural techniques and forest management techniques developed for large estates will have to adapted and 'interpreted' for small owners. A great wealth of silvicultural and forest management knowledge exists in the countries. However, it is not always clear whether these techniques are appropriate for small private owners. Adaptation of these techniques, with the participation of the owners and the extension agents may be necessary. These techniques may also have to be simplified and made appropriate to the socio-economic and education level of the owners.
Good technical content is required. Extension has to be able to help correctly diagnose and solve technical problems that forest owners and stake holders have. In other words it may not be sufficient but it is necessary to have good technical 'packages'. The existing knowledge of scientific forestry and silviculture may not be appropriate for small holders and private forest owners. Therefore applied research on problems particular to small private owners and 'participatory technology development' where stake holders are involved in the process of developing techniques and technologies might be needed.
Private farmland owners will also probably need forestry advice especially in agroforestry, soil and water conservation, environmentally sound agriculture and reforestation, afforestation and the rehabilitation of marginal, degraded and abandoned lands. The privatization of farm land will also create demands for forestry services. In some cases it may be possible to provide supplemental training to those involved in agricultural extension with appropriate backstopping from the forestry departments. In other cases there may be a justification for having extension agents solely concentrating on forestry issues on agricultural land.
For public forest land, mechanisms should be developed to allow for increased public participation and involvement. The present political climate in many countries, including decentralization and liberalization, means that local people and groups may become or wish to become more involved in decision-making, policy development and management of national forests. These forest administrations will have to open themselves further to public input. This trend has already happened in a number of other countries. Mechanisms must be found where this participation is as productive as possible and extension has a role to play. Local forest administrations will require staff with outreach and extension skills who can interact with the public.
Capacity building issues
Communication skills and strategy are important. Private owners have rights and make decisions about their land. Foresters can not use the previous 'command and control' approaches, at least in this tenure category. Listening as well as advise giving skills are needed. Those involved in extension will need training in communication skills - not only in public relations and promoting techniques but in getting feedback and information and priorities from private forest owners.
Communication aspects of extension are more likely to be successful if they are part of a broad strategy and integrated into the extension planning process from the beginning.
Training is required for foresters who work in extension. A cadre of technically well-qualified foresters exists in these countries. To handle the extension needs of the fairly sudden shift to private ownership, it will be necessary to provide part of this cadre with in-service training in extension. Identification of appropriate foresters as extension candidates and the development of a training programme is necessary. One possibly would start with 'training of trainers', a method based on cost-effective multiplication effects. Identification of appropriate foresters as extension candidates and the development of a training programme is necessary.
While much can be done through in-service training it will also eventually be necessary to consider curriculum revisions at the level of the forestry educational institutions. Some extension and extension related topics should be built into the core curriculum and programmes developed for those who wish to specialize in this area.
Private forest owners will need training. Many new owners will have lost touch with forestry and will lack certain forestry and organizational skills. For almost any management objective to be identified by the owners it will be necessary for the owners to receive some training. The extension system should be equipped and staff to provide, facilitate or sub-contract the types of training that are in the most demand and need. Training methodologies should promote participation and the use of local resources. Adult education techniques with emphasis on interactive exercises and practical issues and skills should be explored.
Private forest owners will need socio-economic skills, information and support. New owners will need many types of information and skills in addition to technical ones. Organizational skills will be important as well as economic analysis and information on market trends.
Financial and economic issues
Regular and reliable funding of forestry extension. It is unlikely that small, private forest owners would be prepared to directly pay for extension services themselves. It is also unlikely that the state will have much funding flexibility. However, the state will have to commit itself to fund, at least partly, forestry extension to secure the functioning of the extension framework. Private forest owners could indirectly co-fund extension, through reinvesting royalties or taxes on private forest product sales or land taxes on private forests into forestry extension. The development and implementation of an extension system might benefit from a public relation component. This may be useful to obtain and maintain adequate political and financial support for forestry extension. The involvement of other partners will also be necessary.
Incentives of forestry extension. Private forest owners often need an incentive package which could consist of direct financial or material support, indirect measures, such as tax exemptions or reductions and certain services, e.g. marketing assistance. Incentives packages could be a direct part of the extension system although often they are independent but coordinated. They should leave a certain liberty to chose between different options. Incentive packages have to be clearly formulated and information on them made available to all private forest owners. Systems for monitoring of the effects of incentives need to be developed.
Access to credit. Even if private forest owners would like to invest to improve the productivity of their forests, they often lack investment capital. Since in some CEE countries the restitution and privatization process is implemented in stages (e.g. first earmarking a certain forest area to be restituted, then transferring the usufruct right only, before granting after some time finally the full land title), future-owners and usufruct right holders have no access to credit until they receive full land titles. Governments should be aware that an investment-friendly environment should be created, also through developing attractive ways for the access to credit.
Monitoring the development of economics of private forests. Many Western European states have established a network of representative types of private forest properties to monitor their economical development. The information obtained through these networks enables owners to early identify negative or positive trends, which then can be reacted to accordingly also by government authorities. Hard data are needed to win political and financial support for necessary remedial or facilitating actions.
<section>9</section>
Concluding Remarks
The countries of CEE are presently undergoing significant political and economic change. These changes are complex and affect almost every domain of activity including the forestry sector. Within the countries, for the most part, there has been a fairly radical change in forest ownership patterns - an explosion in the numbers of private forest owners, many with small and fragmented holdings. There is also the need for efficient forest use and participatory approaches to forest decision-making. External influences on the sector include the UNCED commitments and the desire, in many cases, to adhere to the EU framework. Forestry must adapt to these changes and requirements. To meet these demands, especially to support private owners for sustainable forest management and to better integrate forestry and agriculture, the development of dynamic forestry extension systems is essential. These systems, not necessarily totally governmental, should benefit from the range of existing
and emerging organizations and skills. There will continue to be needs for technical input but in addition the tasks of group promotion, management, and coordination are important. Meeting these new needs will require changes in the forestry education and outreach as well as in the other forestry domains.
While there may be some general trends, each of the countries in this region is unique, with its own history, ecology, concerns and approach. Extension systems, while incorporating the lessons learned and the principles of good extension work generally, will have to be inspired by local conditions and circumstances, ecological, historical, social and cultural. There is a broad scope for intra-regional and international cooperation and exchange on extension issues. However, there is some urgency as the economic hardships of transition and their ramifications may run counter to long term sustainable forest management. The sooner flexible systems with high levels of participation and commitment by all partners are developed, the more likely sustainable forestry has the chance to become a reality.

Armenia
Prepared by Karen Ter-Gazarian
Forest cover
Forests cover 459 900 ha, about 11.2% of Armenia. The primary forested areas are in the north, northeast and south, while the central part of the country is almost treeless. An extensive area of heavily exploited, degraded beech and oak forests and bush lands in urban/peri-urban areas has become the main source of fuelwood during the current energy crisis. The overall misuse of natural resources, forests in particular, is mainly the result of the lack of an appropriate legal and economic framework.
Of the total forest area, 4 599 thousand ha, about 70% is high forest, 85% of which is beech, oak and hornbeam. The remainder are coppice forests and shrub forests, which are poorly stocked and degraded. The dominant species are Fagus orientalis, Quercus iberica, Q. macranthera, and Carpinus caucasica.
In 1992, the total standing volume was 38.81 million m, 53% comprised of beech. Almost 80% of the standing stock is located in high forests. Some nine million m of forest are located at high elevations, on steep slopes, without access roads. There is an uneven age distribution of the forest types. The youngest age class, 0-20 years occupies the smallest area.
Forest and resources and management
Armenia is the smallest of the former Soviet republics, 28 800 km, with a population of about 3.7 million people. The break up of the USSR left Armenia with an economic structure highly dependent on energy and raw material imports for its industries, as well as for food. Although suffering from the effects of an economy in transition, from central planning to a market orientation, Armenia has implemented one of the most comprehensive land reform programmes. Land reform, begun in 1991, has resulted in the privatization of most agricultural land and livestock; privatization of light industry and trade and services are underway.
For agriculture, erosion is a major problem, affecting 60% of agricultural land. It is mainly attributed to the uncontrolled overgrazing of pasturelands, which cover about 0.8 million ha, and improper agricultural practices. Grazing also takes place in forest lands. Farm lands and dams for hydropower or for irrigation also need to be protected.
Recently, the transportation system collapsed due to the scarcity of gasoline. This resulted in a break in the normal distribution of fuelwood and was the main cause of severe destruction of the tree cover along city roads and highways, including the devastation of the roadside poplars.
All forests are government owned. Forests belonging to state and collective farms, 'kolkhozes' and 'sovkhozes', have been given to the state. Private forestry will be developed on recently privatized land.
Forest management is still centrally planned and is based on a ten-year plan, with a breakdown of annual tasks. Before independence, the plan was established by committees in Moscow. The present management policy is very conservative and emphasizes the ecological role of forests, while the potential for economic development has not yet been fully considered.
Until 1992, all state forests were surveyed, every ten years, by the Forest Project Institution of Georgia, under the Department of Forests of the Republic of Georgia. Inventories were carried out based on visual judgment supported by some measurements on the standing stock. The compartment description and such inventory formed the basis for designing the forest management plans.
For years wood industry and manufacturing was based on imported wood. In 1988 total imports accounted for about one million cubic meters. Most of the timber and lumber was transported by rail from Russia. The wood industry produced mainly sawn timber, furniture, particle-board, and other products. The large sawmills are mechanized, and nearly all drying is done in kilns. The technology and equipment of the wood industry are out-dated and environmentally unsound. Yet, labour is skilled, cheap and available.
Despite the fact that internal wood demands remain unsatisfied Armenia produces very high quality beech and oak hardwood. Many domestic needs could be satisfied with lower quality, less expensive lumber. Opportunities for exporting high-quality finished products, such as furniture, veneers and parquet, should be explored to produce foreign currency revenues.
Since August 1995, the responsibility for forest policy has been vested in the Ministry of Nature Protection. Forest management is the responsibility of the 'Armforest', State Forest Enterprise (Hayantar), headed by a General Director assisted by four vice-directors, its headquarters are located in Yerevan. The central office has eight divisions:
 forest protection;
 silviculture, forest research and external relations;
 planning and accounting;
 supplies and maintenance;
 forest resources utilization;
 forest products;
 personnel; and
 information.
Hayantar coordinates the activities of 30 forest enterprises at the district level.
Legal framework
The initial Forest Code, adopted in 1978, was not adapted to the ongoing changes in the Armenian economy regarding, in particular, the shift from a centrally planned system to market economy and the emergence of private property. Therefore, a new forest code was adopted in May 1994 by Parliament, and was signed by the President on the 1st of November, 1994. This law was largely inspired by the former Forest Code.
Recent progress in forestry development
A national workshop took place in Yerevan, 15-17 May 1995, where several aspects of forest sector policy were debated. Workshop participants involved concerned parties, public, private, international, and the minister and deputy minister from the Ministry of Agriculture. During the workshop a forestry policy declaration was adopted as a guideline for government forest policy.
This forest policy aims to satisfy objectives related to environmental protection, economic and rural development, and land use. The principles upon which this policy is based are conservation, forestation and regeneration, sustainable multiple-use of forest resources, and maximum participation of private and other non-governmental organizations in forestry development.
Main objectives of the forestry policy outlined in the declaration are to:
 create conditions which lead to proper economic utilization;
 create consistency with other national policies, especially those concerning the environment, agriculture, forest industries, and rural development;
 take account of recent developments in the forest policies of developed countries;
 strengthen the institutional capacity for forest policy formulation, monitoring and execution; and
 enhance forest regeneration, forestation, and rural forestry.
Forest sector development in the medium and long term should be towards self-reliance in this sector.
The forest strategy will:
 integrate Armenian forests into the national economy;
 promote forestation, regeneration and rural forestry; and
 improve forest management, conservation and environmental protection.
Forestry extension goals and examples
Although forestry extension has been in existence for a long time in industrialized countries, where private and communal forests are widespread, it is inadequate in Armenia where state forests predominate. In general, individuals targeted for forest extension are not forest owners and their concerns are mainly agricultural or pastoral. Extension should, therefore, deal with trees outside forests and problems such as watershed protection and rehabilitation and erosion control.
Forestry extension has still not received the governmental attention it deserves. Yet extension would promote the importance of the rational management of forests, woodlands and sustainable use of resources. It would familiarize local people with the advantages of forestry activities outside wooded land, both to meet their needs (fuelwood, non-wood forest products) and to protect the land against water and wind erosion.
Non-governmental organizations could be involved and contribute to field actions, prolonging and diversifying public service action. Moreover, use of modern communication resources (media) should be used more so as to raise awareness and inform the general public of the need for forestry action.
The strategy for the Development of the Armenian Forest sector adopted in the National Workshop underlines the promotion of rural forestry in non-state controlled lands with the help of state forest enterprises.
A serious constraint to this effort is the vagueness of the current legal Forest Code, which does not specify whether forests grown on non-Hayantar land will belong to the state or continue to belong to the entity that owns or controls the afforested land.
Forestry and agroforestry will be promoted by the following means:
 revision of the legal Forest Code and regulations concerning forest land use, especially grazing;
 organization of an official land use arbitration body;
 organization of a forest extension service;
 promotion of private forest nurseries;
 research into appropriate and fast growing trees; and
 promotion of community awareness and knowledge concerning forest growth and use, the destructive effect of uncontrolled grazing, and the environmental implications of forest development.
Proposal for promoting extension
Without ignoring their responsibilities in forest management and law enforcement, forest administrative agents should place more stress on information, persuasion and advice. This entails:
 initiating extension activities to explain policies implemented (also needed for high officials, who have no training in forestry) and promote development;
 assessing requirements and determining the structures available for rural extension; and
 formulating teaching materials (forms, boards, posters, video), disseminating information bulletins and increased cooperation with the media.
Armenia previously had no formal organization responsible for transferring technology and information to farmers, except for 10-20 technical staff members, agronomists, livestock advisors, machinery and plant protection specialists in the Ministry of Agriculture. Although these specialists have mainly administrative and supply-driven functions, they nevertheless can provide information to farmers.
University-level training in forestry is the responsibility of the Forestry Chair of the faculty of agriculture of the Armenian Agricultural Institute, founded in 1992. The course lasts five years. The present target is to have 20-25 graduate forestry generalists with a sub-specialization in silviculture and forestry.
However, theoretical, as well as professional training is poor. The department is in need of field training facilities, laboratory and office equipment. There is no institution where forest technicians can be trained. Isolation from the outside world is also a problem.
There is no forestry school or forestry institute in Armenia. Forestry education must be provided for the forests to be wisely managed. Two options are:
 provision of a government fund to support the education of foresters outside Armenia; and
 establishment of a regional higher education forestry institute in cooperation with neighbouring nations with similar forest conditions and issues.
A central-level organization
A forestry extension programme/service requires a central policy-formulating and coordinating unit, headed by a Director/Chief Officer. The unit would be under the supervision of the Ministry of Nature Protection and Subsoil Wealth. The Director of the Forestry Extension Service would report directly to the minister or deputy minister, on an equal basis with the chief of forestry. The higher the rank of the chief officer responsible for forestry extension, the better the officer's access to top policy-makers, and the importance of extension will be more evident. The main responsibility of the central office, having a limited personnel of four or five people empowered with good communication skills, would be to provide conceptual leadership, coordinate field offices and control financial resources allocated to the field offices for specific forestry extension activities.
A policy on forestry extension, in Armenia, may lead to legal complications. New laws, regulations and by-laws concerning ownership, land-use rights, and the sharing of proceeds from forestry activities may have to be passed to interest the rural population to 'act' as forest managers. Legislation may be required to define what is expected from managers of different types of land and to protect their rights. Therefore, it is advised that legal work should be included as one of the primary functions of a central office for forestry extension.
Forest extension will be implemented mostly by the field staff of the Forest Enterprises (30 people). Provision of forestry extension advice to communes and farmers is an activity Hayantar has not yet performed. This would, therefore, need initial work at the central office, with support from academic and research institutions. Technical assistance would be required to develop suitable technical extension packages and the means for conveying these messages to client groups.
Direct contact with the communes, which will play a major role in agroforestry and the silvo-pastoral development component, will be through forest engineers and technicians stationed at Forest Enterprises. They will receive technical advice from the research institutions via the concerned technical staff at central and field offices. This network should allow for a two-way information flow, so that relevant packages are developed for the end-users. This would involve frequent field work by concerned staff.
At the initial stage, priority will be given to assign both forest engineers and technicians with direct responsibility to give technical advice to those communes selected to take up silvo-pastoral and agroforestry work. At later stages, it is envisaged that each commune will have access to forest technical staff. There would be one engineer in each forest enterprise responsible for extension work.
The duties of the forestry extension worker at the Forest Enterprise will be: to manage the state coppice and shrub forest; to be at the service of the commune to assist and advise on management of communal forests; to advise and supervise nursery workers, and assist private farmers in their tree plantating and forestry activities.
The forest extension worker must give priority to the needs of the commune, has to organize village forestry meetings, and be able to explain the objectives, advantages and implications of forest management.
In some cases, a commune would prefer to contract its own forest engineer to carry out and supervise the work; this communal forester is likely to work for one or two communes. At the village level, small organizations such as NGOs, or technical assistance on a volunteer basis could be involved to help the village organization, or to help develop a participatory approach.
Field-level organizations
The tasks of the field-level organizations in forestry extension are to persuade the rural population to take on the responsibility for forest management and conservation practices, and to provide the required assistance. Some of the responsibilities of a field-level organization in Armenia could be:
 collecting information on land use patterns and problems in the area, and estimating the need for and the production of fuelwood and other primary wood products;
 preparing strategies and plans for improving both land use and resource consumption patterns;
 managing and coordinating programmes, and ensuring that funds received from the central office and other sources are utilized correctly;
 convincing and providing advice to local leaders, farmers, and other land managers of the need for improved forestry practices and, when feasible, forestry initiatives;
 identifying and operating nurseries, organizing planting efforts and creating demonstration plots; and
 providing assistance in the marketing of forest-based products.
It is not necessary that all of the above responsibilities be carried out by the same field organization, or that one particular type of field organization specialize in one or more of the tasks. Actually, there are several means of establishing an organizational structure at the field level, including:
 working through existing agencies or local groups of interested people;
 adding personnel to existing agencies;
 becoming involved in joint extension programmes with different sponsoring agencies; and
 initiating special forestry extension activities;
 establishing a more 'self-contained' field-level organization for forestry extension.
An important consideration in choosing an appropriate organizational structure should be that an adequate field organization is created to have an impact in the area and that use of limited personnel and imported materials is optimized. Importantly, duplication of resources and efforts should be avoided.
Two general approaches to forestry extension work by field organizations towards the rural population are:
 To implement a preconceived extension programme, such as, introducing an agroforestry practice, planting trees on public land, establishing village forests or woodlands, restoring watersheds, or planting deforested areas. Applying the programme implementation approach, a field-level organization, uniform in each, could be established. The form that such an organization would take depends largely upon the tasks to be accomplished. It should have enough qualified people, technical and financial resources, and administrative powers to do the work itself.
 To strengthen the specific capacity of an area or communities for development, such as programmes for integrated rural development. If this approach is taken, the field organization cannot be uniform, but instead must be adaptable to respond to local needs and opportunities for development.
It is advisable to establish a link between the field and the unit responsible for forestry extension programmes at the central-level. When a programme is to be implemented at the local level, this link can consist of instructions and budget provisions from 'above'. There are organizations at the local level, which need to be informed to direct their efforts to supporting the most promising developments. The most effective manner of getting information is to have an employee working in the central unit involved in field activities. Field tours and inspections are other possibilities.
It is not necessary to create new field-level organizations. These can be 'fit in' as new components in an existing network. Any forestry extension activity contemplated must be preceded by careful analysis of the developmental network. One outcome of such an analysis might be that money for forestry extension programmes is given to a voluntary organization working in the area, rather than spending the money on creating a new agency. Another outcome might be that the 'best' use of resources for improving forestry practices in particular area is to offer training courses on specific topics to extension workers.
Especially at the field-level, the choice of organizational structure is a matter relating more to outside forces than to meeting the requirements within the organization itself.
Forestry extension activities
Possible forestry extension programmes include educational campaigns, educational tours, result demonstrations, employment of volunteer leaders, and services relating to information and documentation. Activities include:
 educational campaigns to encourage the adoption of a particular forestry practice;
 educational tours for groups, to observe the situations related to specific forestry problems;
 demonstrations to promote the advantage of improved forestry practices, show the advantage of applying 'scientific methods' to daily situations, and arouse interest by displaying 'old' and 'new' forestry practices side by side; and
 employing volunteer leaders with knowledge and experience.
Leaders generally fall into two groups. The first group being formal leaders, such as a local authority, religious leader, extension worker, or teacher. The second group includes many who may not consider themselves leaders. These people often are called volunteer leaders, unpaid leaders, or informal leaders. An educational programme, such as a forestry extension activity, needs local people who are willing to devote time and effort to plan and carry out a programme. With the help of volunteer leaders, a forestry extension worker can reach more people. In one-half of a day, an extension worker can teach the members of one youth club who, in turn, can teach the members of 10 or 12 clubs. Therefore, in place of helping the members of one club, the extension worker has helped the members of 10 or 12 clubs.
Informational and documentary services
Available information for inclusion in a technical package includes which species can grow under different soil and climatic conditions and what establishment techniques are most efficient under varying conditions.
There is a need for distribution of the following information on:
 the socio-economic conditions of the potential agroforestry participants;
 the possible role of trees in the farming system, both in terms of income generation and the work profile of the farmer;
 the volume production of suggested tree species; and
 the likely utility or market value of produced wood and non-wood products at the end of the rotation period.
There should be very close two-way links between the extension service and forestry research. There is a whole wealth of experience in forestry extension packages and methods, which if utilized properly could avoid expensive mistakes or unnecessary research. There should also be a close link between forestry and agricultural extension. The latter already has an existing structure in Armenia.
Extension models
The most important choice of model is whether a concentrated or widespread approach should be used. In the concentrated approach staff and financial resources would be directed to a few areas. This has the advantage of high penetration in that area. However, simple support and messages over a larger area may reach more people and be more cost effective. In the case of Armenia it may be best to apply a combination of both, by providing seedlings and public information campaigns over a large area and providing a more intensive support to one or two selected areas on a pilot basis.
The concentrated approach includes all or some of the following:
 involvement of local NGOs in the extension and implementation of the agroforestry scheme;
 involvement of the community in agroforestry activities through a village community organization;
 involvement of womens' associations or clubs to provide extension information to the section of the rural population that is most likely to be involved and affected by agroforestry;
 selection of progressive farmers (forerunners) as the entry point in the rural community, to serve as examples for other farmers.
A pilot scheme would be most useful if it included several approaches that would be subject to close monitoring supported by socio-economic expertise.
Training
There is an obvious need for training of forestry staff at all levels in matters concerning agroforestry. This training should be short and practical. One day training sessions in the farmers own location can be very effective. Longer courses would be required for farm nursery operators.
Participation
Traditional foresters, not only in Armenia, have little experience and understanding of how to work with the farming community. One of their most important tasks has always been to prevent people from exploiting trees. For that reason the farmers often have a negative attitude towards foresters. Furthermore, foresters are accustomed to implement a centrally planned programme - a top-down approach. If tree planting should be successful, it has to be perceived as being in the farmers own interest. This means that a bottom-up approach is most likely to succeed. This requires a fundamental change of the forester's attitude.
Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was developed to overcome the communication problems between foresters and local farmers. Ideas are exchanged through systematized interaction. PRA can substantially increase the foresters knowledge of socio-economic problems and at the same time increase the farmers knowledge and trust of foresters.
Evaluation of forestry extension programmes
There are no established criteria to employ in meeting this important evaluative requirement. However, a number of critical questions can be asked to evaluate the possibilities of success or failure of forestry extension programmes.
Among these questions are:
 Are the extension 'delivery techniques' appropriate for the local community and the intended audience?
 Is extension working in cooperation with related organizations and agencies?
 Are local leaders and representatives involved in setting priorities and in planning activities?
 Is there a systematic method of rotating community members participating in the forestry extension programmes?
 Do extension staff and the community members appreciate and relate to their respective roles and responsibilities?
 Is local information collected and analyzed before setting priorities?
 Are volunteers being employed when possible to augment the effectiveness of the extension staff?
 Is the educational level of local extension agents reflective of the training of the clients?
 Are the extension field staff being updated on new knowledge and innovative techniques?
 Does the system of promotion in the forestry extension programme reward office work and neglect field work?
 Are appropriately trained extension staff being recruited and kept?
 Are funding agencies and the public being kept informed of the progress on major extension objectives?
Legal framework for forestry extension
The new Forest Code of Armenia, adopted in 1994, establishes that all forests are state owned and that the State prepares and implements forest management plans, requiring authorizations for exploitation, and generally controls the sector. The Code does not introduce any major obstacles towards the privatization of the forestry sector. Developments may be made through allowing forestry activities on private land, through allowing private entrepreneurs to utilize state forests, allowing access to the wood-processing industry and trade.
It is expected that forestry activities will develop on private land at some time. This is due to the recent privatization of agricultural lands, which will bring about a need to delimit properties and protect them from wind and water erosion. Private owners will also seek to obtain fuelwood, as well as fruit or other produce, from trees planted on their properties, for domestic consumption or even commercial purposes. On the other hand, given the current extreme need for fuelwood and the frequency of illegal cuttings, owners of land may avoid planting trees considering the difficulties of controlling possible thefts of the wood.
The Forestry Code needs to be clarified to encourage private owners to reforest their own land. It could be stated that forests developed on private land do not become part of the state forest estate. As it stands the Code does not prohibit the creation of private forests. Appropriate provisions could specify that the system of planning and controlling the forest sector as it results from the Code and the regulations could be adopted if necessary. These provisions would be useful in light of the land legislation, which requires economic and environmentally sound use of private land.
Under such legislation, private owners would encounter the risk of having their land expropriated if cutting trees was considered environmentally unsound. Even if land legislation is not revised, the Forest Code or regulations could help by legalizing (without excessive formalities) the harvesting of planted trees.
Private forests
The development of private forestry activities would also be facilitated by granting all possible technical assistance from the Government to people who undertake planting of trees on their land. For these purposes, it is suggested to add to the law one article. The article suggested is:
"Trees or forests planted on private land are the property of the owner of the land or of any person to whom the owner of the land has granted a right of ownership of such trees.
Unless otherwise specified, the provisions of this Code do not apply to trees or forests planted on private land. The Ministry responsible for forestry may make regulations for the encouragement of trees and forests planted on private land.
The Government department responsible for forestry shall provide technical assistance to forestry activities undertaken on private land."
As to private forestry activities, which may be undertaken on state lands, the law already provides a framework by regulating access to state forests through various kinds of authorizations. Experience in many countries, however, shows that to meet the needs of local communities for forest produce, it is useful to encourage initiatives which may be carried out by the community itself in this regard. In the case of rural populations working in agricultural and grazing, it would be useful if they considered jointly their needs and, with the help of the forestry administration, undertook necessary forestry activities in nearby forests to obtain the necessary produce on the basis of an appropriate plan.
Parcels of the state forest estate, which appear to be suitable for this purpose, would have to be identified by the forestry administration and made available on reasonably attractive terms. Except in the case of commercially viable forests, the group entering into such an agreement should be exempted from the payments normally due for forest lease agreements.
For example, this arrangement might be considered for state forests formally within the domain of state and collective farms (kolkhozes and sovkhozes). These total approximately 50 000 ha and are reported to be mainly in degraded condition, so that such an arrangement should also facilitate their improvement.
Community forestry
The possibility of entering into such agreements is not presently given under the Code, although article 22 allows parcel leases of the forest estate. The law would not need to set out many rules in this regard, but should guide activities along the following lines:
"The Government department responsible for forestry may enter into an agreement under article 22 of this law with any groups of residents of an area, with respect to parcels of the forest estate situated in that area or a nearby area.
In addition to the requirements of article 22, an agreement under this article shall include a plan of the activities to be carried out, such as silvicultural and any other forestry activities.
The duration of an agreement under this article and any applicable conditions may be different from those otherwise provided for under this law. The agreement may be exempted from payments otherwise required under this law. The Ministry responsible for forestry may make regulations for the encouragement of agreements under this article.
Throughout the implementation of an agreement under this article, the parties thereto shall be eligible for technical assistance from the Government Department responsible for forests."
Proposed financial arrangements
Incentives may be required to encourage land-owners to become part of a forestry-related development process and to halt the misuse of natural resources. Where forest management and conservation measures directly benefit society these costs should not be absorbed exclusively by farmers.
The most commonly applied incentives in forestry-related developmental projects are:
 direct cash incentives - subsidies, wage subventions, credit, revolving funds, and cost-sharing arrangements;
 direct incentives in kind - food, production inputs, tools and equipment, domestic animals and wildlife species, animal feed, irrigation systems, use of water, technical advice, and transportation services; and
 indirect incentives - fiscal, provision of services; and social incentives.
An incentive programme should be well articulated with other support elements in rural development framework, or have a temporary 'catalytic' role.
Organization of expected forest owners
Future private forest owners in Armenia could be organized into Community Based Groups (CBGs). These are formal and informal groups of local people.
The main activities of CBGs would be:
 preparation and management of wood and non-wood forest product sales;
 management of thinning, sanitation, regeneration and tree-planting;
 wood and non-wood forest product processing; and
 provision of information and further education to their members.
Summary
In order to encourage private forest enterprises, Armenia should also consider development of a forestry extension service. More than 65% of farmers created by the recent agricultural privatization policy have had no farming experience and cannot be expected to understand the opportunities inherent in agroforestry without training and assistance. The extension staff does not have to be large, but should be assigned to duty on a full time basis. If their job performance responsibilities are tied directly to the success rate of small forest endeavors, they will be more effectively focused on problems of the small operator.
Finally, the importance of forests and forest products should be introduced to the public school system in order to develop a strong constituency for forest interests over the long term. In the competitive market economy that is to evolve, public support will be of great assistance in acquiring government for forestry investments.

Forest cover
Presently, forests cover 2.9 million ha or 44% of Latvia. In 1935 forest cover was 1.7 million ha or 28% of the country. Tree species composition is dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) 40%, Norway spruce (Picea abies) 21%, birch (Betula spec.) 28%, black alder (Alnus glutinosa) 2%, aspen (Populus tremula) 3%, white alder (Alnus incana) 5%, oaks (Quercus spec.) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) 1%.
Forest distribution is irregular. Areas with higher forest cover are located in the central Riga region, the centre-east Cesis and Madona region, and in the northwest Ventspils and Talsi regions. The Dobele region has the lowest forest cover, 26%. The forested areas are divided into five forest soil types:
 dry mineral 58%;
 wet mineral 10%;
 wet peat 12%;
 drained mineral 10%; and
 drained peat 10%.
Middle-aged forest stands are strongly represented, 48%. The mean current increment is 6.30 cbm/ha and the annual increment is 16.5 million cbm. In 1995, the total allowable cut was 8.35 million cbm. The actual cut was about 6.89 million cbm.
Forestry is a major factor in Latvia's economy and contributed 10% of the GDP in 1994. Major exports are roundwood, sawn timber and panel products. The main importers are the UK (43%) and Sweden (26%). In 1994, wood and wood-product exports were 20% of all export commodities in Latvia.
Latvian forests are further classified into three categories according to grade of protection and intensity of allowed forest management activities:
 protected forests 10% - includes strict nature reserves, national and nature parks, nature reserves, anti-erosion forests, suburban parks;
 restricted management forests 16% - includes protected landscape and suburban forests and those which serve to protect the environment; and
 commercial forests 74%.
There are also 248 200 ha of specially protected forests within restricted management and commercial forests.
Ownership structure
The recent dramatic political, social and economic changes in central and eastern Europe, also resulted in the transformation of forest ownership patterns. The law clearly states that land areas, under private ownership up to 21 June 1940, are to be returned to former owners or their inheritors. This land reform is being implemented in two stages. The first stage transfers land use rights to present land users or former land owners. The second stage fully acknowledges land property rights of former land owners.
In 1983 state forests covered 1 750 thousand ha. This fell to 1 624 in 1995. Cooperative farms reduced their holdings from 893 thousand hectares in 1983 to 322 thousand hectares in 1995; community forests, owned by cities, towns and other settlements rose from 123 thousand ha in 1983 to 321 thousand ha in 1995.
Planned ownership patterns project the following figures: state forest area 55%, cooperative farms 2%, community 2%, private forest 37% and others 4%.
The above figures show that in 1983 there were no private owners, but in 1995 a total of 18% of the land was privately held. Ownership, for other groups rose from 4% to 11%.
The second stage of land reform began in 1993. Under the privatization law, about 1.3 million ha of forests could be privatized amounting to 44% of the total forest area. During the land reform process, 258 000 applications for restitution and privatization were submitted for a total of 3 083 million ha of land, including about 705 00 ha of forest land, 26% of total forest land.

The above figures might change, if the Government of Latvia implements the Programme for the Afforestation of Abandoned Agricultural Lands, or if agricultural land is not cultivated and natural succession turns them into forests. According to some estimates there will be up to 200 000 small- or medium-sized private forest holdings.
Forest resources and management
The Law on Forest Management and Utilization came into force in 1992 and was revised in March 1994 to accommodate changes in forest ownership.
Forest management of state-owned forests
The basic principles for forest management are defined in the Law on Forest Management and Utilization. The principle state authority for forestry is the State Forest Service of Latvia, organized into four administrative levels:
 ministerial unit;
 35 district offices;
 259 forest districts; and
 2 159 ranger districts.
The State Forest Service manages state-owned forests. As part of the Ministry of Agriculture, it is directed by a State Minister of Forests. Forest inventory and forest management planning are performed by the State Forest Inventory Institute, financed and supervised by the State Forest Service.
Private forests
The revised Law on Forest Management and Utilization sets out the rights and duties of private forest owners. Private holdings with more than 1 000 ha, must hire a professional forester as manager. Smaller holdings are to invite a consultant, once a year, to plan management activities for the current year. The State Forest Service functions on a payment basis and is liable for a period of three years for consultation.
Forest inventory and the preparation of management plans is done by the State Forest Inventory Institute at the expense of the owners. Currently, the Institute charges about $US5 per ha for the preparation of management plans. Owners often face difficulties in paying for the plans. Forest owners are obliged to reforest harvested and cleared forest areas. If they fail to comply, the State Forest Service undertakes this work at the owner's expense.
In 1992, a Rural Innovation Center was established, with assistance from the United States, at the Ogre Forest Training and Education Center/Technical College. As its first activity, the Center founded the Forest Owners' Association in 1993. At present, the Association has about 700 members, who pay a small annual membership fee. Average holding size is 5.6 ha per member. The president of the association was elected in October 1993 to serve a three-year term. The president is concurrently Head of the Department of Forestry of the Latvian Agricultural Advisory Service, and the Vice-Director of the Ogre Technical Forestry College in charge of postgraduate studies. The president receives a salary from the Ministry of Agriculture for the position of Vice-Director of the Technical Forestry College.
The Association is a non-profit organization, and currently conducts training courses for volunteer advisers, who are independent consultants with a forestry education. At the end of training, the volunteer advisers receive a certificate. This certifies them as consultants to private forest owners, recommended by the Association. The courses and certificates are not recognized by state authorities.
Currently, there are 32 volunteer advisers, some are employees of the State Forest Service, others teachers at agricultural schools or farmers. There is a need for about 900 volunteer advisers - one adviser covers about 1 500 ha of private forests with 1.3 million ha of assumed total private forest area. The Forest Owners' Association is trying to establish a private forest extension service, since this does not exist in the institutional framework of the State Forest Service.
Besides training volunteer advisers, the Association provides timber marketing services to interested private owners. For these marketing services a charge is made of 2% of the price of sold timber. In the future, the Association plans to establish local associations in each district. Problems envisaged, in this respect, are connected to past history; forced cooperation, the shortsighted behavior of owners and related economic difficulties. The president of the Association identified the main problem of forest owners as lack of credit. This again is connected to the process of privatization and, in particular, to the slow delivery of land titles to owners.
State support to private forest sector
Presently, state support to the private forest sector covers salary payment for the president of the Forest Owners' Association, funds training facilities for courses conducted by the Forest Owners' Association in Ogre and provides office space for the Forest Owners' Association. Management plans are prepared against payment and a consultancy service is provided by the State Forest Service.
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Latvia has requested assistance for two projects to develop private forestry. The first project, Technical Assistance for the Development of Private Forestry, to be financed by a PHARE grant. The second forestry extension project to be financed by the National Board of Forestry, Sweden. Both proposals aim to develop a forestry extension service within the institutional framework of the State Forest Service of Latvia and to strengthen the process of creating private forest-owner associations.
Forestry extension goals and examples
There has, so far, been no formal training of the staff of the State Forest Service in forestry extension. The Faculty of Forestry at the University of Agriculture and the Technical Forestry College at Ogre do not have forestry extension as a subject on the curricula. The Faculty leadership, however, is considering including this subject in the future. The Faculty's Department of Wood Processing is conducting surveys on the economics of private forest holdings with financial assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture.
Training of private forest owners
There is no formal structure or standardized programme to educate and train private forest owners. The Forest Owners' Association has produced information material and has initiated the broadcasting of television programmes.
Forestry research and the private forest sector
The Latvian Forestry Research Institute, 'Silava', has suffered a drastic reduction in staff since the political change. At present no research projects exist for private forestry needs. There is a weak link between research carried out at the Institute and that being done at the Faculty of Forestry.
The following research needs have been identified by the Director of the Forestry Research Institute:
 research on species for afforestation especially mykorizza and fast-growing species;
 forestation research on difficult sites;
 silvicultural research on Close to Nature forest management (how to transform even-aged stands into multi-layered forest stands);
 research on agroforestry trials and on non-wood forest products for alternative land use and income generation;
 obtaining socio-economic information on private forest owners;
 an economic evaluation of afforestation species, comparing results with economics of different agricultural crops; and
 establishment of a permanent monitoring network for the economics of private forestry.
The two final items listed have received the highest priority among the identified research topics. The main problem faced in carrying out research is lack of sufficient funding.
Summary
The Ministry of Agriculture, State Forest Service seeks to design and implement a complete extension system, consisting of a forestry extension service and incentive packages. Minimal state support is provided to private forest owners. The State Forest Service should consult all parties concerned before deciding on the nature of a future forestry extension service. The four institutional possibilities seem to be:
 a forestry extension service created within the State Forest Service;
 a private forestry extension service; and
 forestry extension provided as part of the agriculture extension system or a combination of the above.
It seems that present developments are directed towards a combined approach. In the absence of a decision regarding a future extension service, the Forest Owners' Association has developed a type of privatized forestry extension service. Forest owners, however, can also consult employees of the State Forest Service. A connection is made to agricultural extension, since the president of the Forest Owners' Association is also the Head of the Department of Forestry at the Latvian Agricultural Advisory Center. However, the organization structure and the assignment of tasks is not clear. Even if a privatized forestry extension structure is chosen the State Forest Service will need an organization unit to coordinate government support and fulfill monitoring and control functions.
Once a decision has been made regarding the nature of the forestry extension service, the training requirements of extension personnel need to be identified and a training programme formulated. Regardless of the nature of the future extension service, it should be the duty of the State Forest Service to lobby for state budget support in connection with its development.
In order to overcome structural difficulties in the private forestry sector, an incentive package has to be designed to assist and stimulate private forest owners to coordinate their efforts, and manage their properties following the principles of sustainability. As this is in the public interest, the financing of an incentive package should be the responsibility of the State. A partial solution to the problem of financing forestry extension could be found in reinvesting tax paid on private forest property into forestry extension.
The two above mentioned project proposals on forestry extension prove that the State Forest Service is in the process of taking action on the development of a forestry extension system.
The Faculty of Forestry at the University of Agriculture, and the Technical Forestry College, will have to adapt to training forestry extension personnel. Specialized training should be incorporated into the relevant curricula.
Forestry research needs close cooperation on all levels for concerted action in the interest of private forestry development. The ties between the different research institutions, including the universities, should be strengthened. A Board of Forestry Research, with members from the Forestry Research Institute, the Faculty of Forestry, the State Forest Service, decision makers from forest industries and private forest owners, could systematically prioritize, distribute and finance forestry research projects.
Forestry research in Latvia should be harmonized with research programmes in neighbouring countries. Latvia already closely cooperates with Estonia and Lithuania on forestry research.
The State Forest Service has expressed an interest in regional training and exchange of information and experience on Forestry Extension Development, especially in the countries of central and eastern Europe.

Lithuania
Prepared by T. Marghescu
Forest cover
Lithuania is the largest Baltic state, with an area of 65 300 km and a population of about 3.8 million. Before World War II, 85% of all forests were managed by the state and about 15% were privately owned. After the war, when Lithuania became fully integrated into the economy of the former USSR, Lithuanian forests were generally in poor condition. In terms of forest composition the main tree species are pine (Pinus) 37%, spruce (Picea) 24%, birch (Betula) 19% and alder (Alnus) 12%. In 1948, the agricultural cooperatives were established and private forest ownership abolished. Until 1990, Lithuania's forests were almost exclusively managed by the state (state forest enterprises) and the collective farm system.
Forest resources and management
The restoration of independence, on 11 March 1990, began a drastic process of political, social and economic transformation, which has profoundly affected the forestry sector. All forest land was first transferred to the country-wide network of 43 state forest enterprises under the Ministry of Forestry. No clear policy has been outlined in terms of privatization and restitution (the return of state property to former private owners) of forest property. Two acts constitute the legal basis for land restitution and privatization - the Law on Land Reform, adopted 25 July 1991, and the Law on the Conditions of Citizens Rights to Real Estate Property Restitution, adopted 9 July 1991.
In 1991, the policy was to restrict the size of private forest estates to a maximum of 10 ha per individual owner. Private forest property was to be granted only in production forest areas, meaning that all protected forest areas would have remained under state management. This solution would have left, overall, about 95% of forests in Lithuania under the management of the State Forest Administration.
In the space of a year the maximum size of forest estates per individual owner was raised from a maximum of 10 to a maximum of 25 ha. In the southeast of the country, there were, however, no limits provided as to size of individual private forest estates. The government is considering the possibility of raising the private forest estate size maximum of 50 ha per individual.
Confusion in the restitution process is created by changing maximum size limits of individual private forest estates and through regulations enabling individuals, entitled to receive agricultural land through the restitution process, to claim forest land instead. Furthermore, individuals, with the right to claim forest land, are able to choose monetary compensation instead. At present, the outcome of the privatization and restitution process is unclear.
The Government of Lithuania has designated 450 000 ha of forests, formerly managed by the collective farm system, and 288 000 ha of forests, managed by state forest enterprises, for restitution and privatization purposes, of this an approximate 600 000 ha will be restituted or privatized. Private forests, amounting to 600 000 ha would account for 30% of all Lithuanian forests. It is now a government policy that 70%, and not less than 60%, of forests remain under the management of the State Forest Administration. Forests designated for restitution and privatization are not all production forests, and about 50 000 ha are situated in protected areas and are restricted in their use.
Responsibility for surveying, evaluation and land demarcation of new private forest estates is divided between two organizations. The Forest Management Institute in Kaunas, under the Ministry of Forestry, is responsible for private forest property in the areas of state forest enterprises. The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for formerly cooperative farm forest property. The institutions combine the process of restitution with compensation, in order to improve the negative structure of private forest property at the base year of restitution in 1940.

Ownership structure
Up until February 1995, the Forest Management Institute surveyed and demarcated about 45 000 ha of forest for approximately 7 000 individual owners. The average size of the individual estate was reported to be six hectares. Some 110 000 former agricultural cooperative forests have been surveyed and demarcated for about 15 500 individual owners with an average property size of 7 ha. Therefore, as of February 1995, there are approximately 155 000 ha of private forests, about 9% of the total forest area owned by 22 500 individuals whose average property size falls between six and seven hectares.
The present forest land value, formerly managed by state forest enterprises is, on average, 450 Litas/ha, the average stand value is 900 Litas/ha, resulting in an average market price of 1 350 Litas/ha. Forests belonging to former collective farms are valued at a somewhat lower price.
The relatively small size, and scattered distribution of individual forest properties, makes for a difficult starting position for sustainable forest management. This could be equalized through the establishment of cooperative structures in private forestry. This concept is opposed after living with 50 years of forced 'cooperation'. Furthermore, the situation is aggravated by the fact that the Constitution of Lithuania forbids cooperative properties. Small properties will be further divided through inheritance. The knowledge of private forest owners of forest management is low. Many new private forest owners do not live near their forests, but in distant cities or even abroad.
Financial arrangements
Under the 1994 Forest Act, a forest management plan is prepared for every forest estate of more than three hectares. These plans are also prepared for estates smaller than three hectares, if the estate is situated within a larger forest tract. The Forest Management Institute in Kaunas used to be in charge of national forest inventories and forest management plans of state forest enterprises. However, at present, the institute is forced to give inventories a lower priority, as management plans are also being prepared for private forest owners.
Field surveillance accounts for about 75% of the cost of a management plan, which is paid by the state. However, the private forest owner pays for the preparation of the plan, or project itself, about 25% of total costs. Management plan preparation is very slow. The process needs to be evaluated and speeded up. To this end, utilization of the services of independent, certified surveyors is under discussion.
The Lithuanian Private Forest Owners' Association was founded 27 April 1993 by forestry professionals from the Forest Research Institute, some of whom became private forest owners. The Association subsequently was registered with the Ministry of Justice as a public organization. The Association is lead by a Board, having 11 members, elected for a period of three years. In February 1995 the Association had about 200 members.
Private forest owners, wishing to join the Association, have to submit an application form. The Association is a member of the Lithuanian Chamber of Agriculture and is on good terms with the Union of Land Owners of Lithuania and the Union of Farmers. The objectives of the Association are to:
 assist former private forest owners in the restitution of their property rights;
 influence the formulation of legislation to the advantage of private forest owners;
 provide professional advice to the members of the Association;
 organize the formation of cooperation between owners of small private forest estates in order to facilitate management and utilization of forest resources;
 collaborate with other farmers' and land owners' organizations; and
 collaborate with associations of forest owners from other countries.
The Association was not formally consulted when the Forest Act was formulated. However, the Association provided unsolicited comments on drafts of the Act and received a response from the highest level. The Forest Act was passed by Parliament in December 1994 and contains the intention of the government to support the activities of the Association. Up until February 1995, however, government support had not materialized.
The Association is now formally consulted in the process of formulating regulations following the enactment of the Forest Act in December 1995. Four consultative meetings have already been held in this respect with the participation of the Association as representative of private forest owners.
The Association is presently active in enlarging its membership numbers and in establishing a country-wide network of small cooperatives of private forest owners. A leaflet, prepared by the Association, contains a list of specialists addresses and telephone numbers, prepared to give advice, presently still free-of-charge, to private forest owners. The Association has published and distributed a calendar for 1995 with useful tips and information for private forest owners. Close links have been established with a Danish Forest Owners' Association. Plans have been made for exchange visits and for closer cooperation between the two associations with financing received from the European Union.
The Private Forest Owners' Association has made a list of the main problems facing private forest owners:
 the present maximum limit of estate size (25 ha);
 restrictions faced by private forest owners in protected forest areas (compensation);
 difficulties in obtaining forest cutting permission;
 lack of knowledge of private forest owners of forest management;
 lack of state administration advisory services, according to law these should exist. There are no appointed contacts in the state administration for private forest owners requesting assistance. Private forest owners, therefore, sometimes contact the Prime Minister of Lithuania directly to seek advice;
 private forest owners do not receive any incentives;
 in some cases, state forest enterprises have cut, and or utilized, forest areas earmarked for restitution one year before their actual restitution to former owners. These cleared areas were not replanted. This was declared the responsibility of the new owner;
 trespassing of state forest enterprise personnel game hunting on private forest land; and
 state forest enterprises charge high fees for services, such as marking trees for cutting (e.g., one Litas/km is charged for transport of officers to and from the private forest, in addition to seven Litas/hour for actual work in the forest. Representatives of the Association remarked that, with these fees, it is cheaper for private forest owners to buy timber from state forest enterprises, rather than harvesting their own trees).
Forestry extension goals and examples
The State Administration is presently unable to provide organized assistance and advice to the private forest sector. At present, state forest enterprise personnel try to carry out extension work, mainly restricted to law monitoring and enforcement activities. There is, at present, no forestry extension system, having objectives, institutional framework, tools (e.g., an incentive package) and trained personnel. Thus, sustainable forest management of private forests can not be ensured.
The education curricula, at the higher- and mid-level for forestry professionals, do not contain forestry extension. The personnel of the state administration does not yet understand the concept of a participatory approach and the necessity of building a partnership with the private forest sector. The Ministry of Forestry is aware of the problem and has requested technical assistance.
The need to develop a more systematic and substantive approach to forestry extension is felt by the stake holders in forestry in Lithuania. There is also a willingness to share information and experience on forestry extension with other colleagues in the region and beyond. With training of trainers and a good grasp of extension principles, an extension system for sustainable forestry, appropriate to Lithuanian conditions, could be developed.

Forest cover
Forests cover 8.6 million ha, almost 28% of Poland, and are dominated by coniferous stands of mainly Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The contribution of forestry to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is rather low (0.4%), but this does not include the value of the environmental and socio-economic contributions of forests. In 1993, the per capita forest area in Poland was 0.226 ha. The average standing timber volume is 172 cbm/ha.
Presently, only about 61% of the forest increment is harvested. The health condition of forests in southwest Poland is poor, due to industrial pollution. However, the situation has improved for the first time in a decade due, in part, to the shut down of polluting industries in Poland and Germany.
In the past, unsuitable spruce provenances were planted in the mountain areas resulting in low resistance of stands to environmental stress. Forests in northeast Poland are in better health. These forest stands show Close to Nature Composition (CNC). In 1993, protected forests constituted 47% of the total state forest area. There were 20 national parks, 100 natural reserves, 100 landscape parks and 263 protected landscape areas forming an impressive network of protected forest areas.
Forest resources and management
In 1995, a programme for nature protection was formulated. Forestry is under the auspices of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources and Forestry, proof of Poland's attempt to fulfill its commitments arising from the international process following UNCED. Seven forest-promotional complexes were established in 1994 and 1995. These complexes serve professional foresters as experimental, demonstration, research and promotional centers.
A new forest policy, which takes into consideration interaction with other sectors and their policies, was under preparation and submitted for approval by Parliament in the second half of 1996.
Ownership structure
Central and eastern Europe, including Poland, has recently undergone dramatic political, social and economic transformation. In comparison to other countries in the region, changes in forest ownership patterns were not as drastic in Poland. Large and medium-sized, private forest estates (mostly 25 ha) were nationalized after World War II. Small, private forest property, however, survived (16% of total forest area).

Today, there are approximately 1.4 million forest owners, owning a total of 1.4 million ha of forest (16% of the total forest area), an average private forest holding of only 1 ha/owner.

Private forest holdings are concentrated in southern Poland, a distribution of close to 50:50% share between private and state forest ownership. There is hardly any private forest ownership in western Poland, where all forests were nationalized after the war. There are substantial quality and quantity differences between state and private forests. In respect of state forests growing stock is 200 cbm/ha with an average age of 55 years and an annual increment of 3.6 cbm/ha/year. Private forests have a growing stock of 107 cbm/ha with an average age of 37 years and an annual increment of 2.7 cbm/ha/year.
One reason for low quality private forests is that farmers used to reforest farmland with low quality soils in order to save taxes.
The law states that forest areas must be reforested not later than two years after logging. However, presently, 6% of private forests have not been reforested. With the restitution of nationalized property to former owners it is expected that not much more than 20% of forests will become private property.
Planned forest ownership pattern
According to the policy statement for planned forest ownership the state will own 7 470 000 ha (76%); the community 120 000 ha (1%); private 2 104 000 ha (21%); private groups 70 000 ha (0.7%); private business 100 000 ha (1.0%); others 16 000 ha (0.2%) for a total of 9 880 000 ha by the year 2015.
However, this figure might change through privatization, not restitution, of former cooperative farms. Substantial areas of former cooperative farmland has not been cultivated for years. Natural succession will turn these lands slowly into low quality forest.
The National Forestation Programme, was adopted by the government in 1995. It was implemented in 1996 with the objective of increasing the present forest cover of 28% to 30% by the year 2020, in other words to afforest 700 000 ha of mainly marginal agricultural land, 60% of which is to be carried out on private land.
Institutional arrangements
The Act Concerning Forests, which came into effect on 1 January 1992, contains provisions both for state owned and private forests. Previously, there were separate laws and regulations for private and state owned forests.
State owned forests
Under the 1992 Act, state owned forest is the property of the State Treasury. Management of state owned forest is performed by the State Forest Enterprise which is organized into three administrative levels:
 General Directorate of Forests headed by the Director General and 120 staff members;
 17 Regional Directorates of State Forests with 12-30 forest districts each; and
 437 forest districts of 18 000-20 000 ha each.
The State Forest Enterprise is supervised by the Minister of Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and Forestry. The Minister is supported by the professional assistance of the Forest Department.
Private forests
Previously, private forest owners owned their forests while the state managed them. Private forest owners recently received the right to manage their own forest. The management of private forests is supervised by the 'Voivod', a political, administrative unit, or province, with governors appointed by the head of state. No forestry specialists work for the 'Voivod' governors. Therefore, the 1992 Act provides that governors may entrust the regional directorates of state forests, or the directors of forestry districts, to carry out elements of the supervision of private forests on their behalf.
The State Forest Enterprise is paid for its services by the 'Voivods' (state administration). However, in 1995, the amount received by the State Forest Enterprise to carry out the supervision of forest management on 1.3 million ha private forests covered only 70% of the actual cost.
The supervision of private forests is based on the forest management master plan, prepared at the request of the 'Voivod' governors, and at the expense of the state budget, by the State Forest Management Bureau (eight regional branches) or commissioned, independent forestry professionals. Presently, only 40% of non-state forests are provided with a management plan. An anticipated revision of the 1992 Act foresees only the preparation of forest management master plans for forest complexes larger than 10 ha.
The data contained in the forest management master plan also forms the basis for forest property taxation. Under the 1992 Act, tree stands up to the age of 40 years are exempt from forest tax. The average age of non-state forest is only 37 years as compared to the average age of state owned forests having 55 years.
Where the private forest is disbursed and there is no geographical connection to state forest property, supervision is carried out by about 500 specialists, who each look after an average of 1 800 ha of private forest. In cases where private forest property is part of a larger, mostly state owned forest tract, 2 700 district forestry officers supervise the management of an average of 210 ha of private forest concurrent with their task of managing the state owned forest itself.
Staff carry out specialized work (supervision of private forest owners) without having had specialized training, and without having been specially selected. This is also true for district officers, who supervise private forests as a side-line duty. There is only one forestry professional who deals with both the Forestry Department of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources and the General Directorate of Forest (State Forest Enterprise). Again, only one forestry professional is in charge of private forest supervision at each of the 17 Regional Directorates of State Forests and at each District Forest Office, one person coordinates private forest supervision activities of District Forest Office staff.
Several attempts have been made to stimulate the formation of forest owner associations, which is regarded as essential to efficiently supervise the management of the fragmented, small, private forest enterprises. So far, there is not a single private forest owners' association in Poland.
Private forest owners carry out management activities in their forests themselves and usually do not contract professional companies. In the majority of cases, private forest owners do not have specialized training to carry out forest management activities. There are no statistics available for accidents suffered by private forest owners, working in their forests.
State support to the private forest sector
The State Forest Enterprise does not make any distinction between state forest and private forest in relation to its forest fire and pest management activities, and thus provides services free of charge to private forest owners in the prevention, monitoring and combating of forest fires and pests.
Forest management plans are prepared for private forests with the approval, or based on, the initiative of 'Voivod' governors and with state budget funding. Tax exemptions are made for forests not older than 40 years. Occasional, non-obligatory or systematic marketing assistance is provided by State Forest District Offices in the sale of harvested timber. Seedlings are given free of charge for forestation, but not as yet for reforestation.
Forestry extension goals and examples
Education of forestry professionals on forestry extension
Formal forestry education in Poland is conducted at:
 the forestry faculties of the Warsaw Agricultural University and the Agricultural Universities of Poznan and Krakow;
 17 secondary forest schools;
 49 training and instructive establishments; and
 the Center of Forest Culture and Museum of Forestry in Goluchow.
Several elements of the curricula at these education and training institutions cover various aspects of forestry extension (e.g., economics and forest management), but there is no specific subject taught on forestry extension. The leadership of the forestry faculties, forestry research institutes and the directors of the Regional Directorates of State Forests recently identified the need for increased training of students in forestry extension. However, some officials do not assign much importance to specific training in forestry extension. Traditional knowledge and skills in forest management were thought to be sufficient to carry out the supervision of private forests.
Training of private forest owners
There is no systematic programme or scheme to train private forest owners in Poland. The 'Voivod' governors are responsible for this training. The State Forest Enterprise would be in the position to conduct training. However, there is no 'Voivod' governors with corresponding financial remuneration. Information brochures and management guidelines are not available for private forest owners.
Forestry research and private forest sector
Currently, there is no research programme on private forestry or forestry extension in the activity profile of the Forestry Research Institute in Warsaw. This is because the State Forest Enterprise only funds research connected to state forests. There is no funding available for forestry research on private forest and forestry extension. The personnel of the Forestry Research Institute in Warsaw was only vaguely aware that the University of Agriculture in Warsaw was conducting research on the economics of mixed (agriculture and forestry) private farm enterprises.
Research needs have been identified connected with forestry extension focused on the economics of private forests and forestation. Experimentation, with and demonstration of, agroforestry models and the search for economically interesting non-wood forest products to add value and immediate income possibilities to private forest (and forestation area) owners were mentioned in this context.
Summary
Poland has a long-standing tradition in forestry. The state forest sector is well-managed by professionals with high standards. An extraordinary high proportion of state forests in Poland are nature protected and the state forest sector is responding to the international agreements and recommendations on the sustainable management of forest resources in an exemplary way.
The private forest sector, however, seems to be the 'orphan' of forestry in Poland. The existing framework for forestry extension is not functioning. The Forest Act of 1992 and the forestry profession uses the term 'supervision' of private forests. This term often reflects one-way communication and a top-down understanding of forestry extension, which may not contain the spirit of dialogue, participation, serving and assisting.
One of the main reasons private forest owners show no interest in collaborating could be connected to the distrust they have towards their supervisors. The history of past, forced collaboration between owners is too recent, and private forest owners, therefore, are not ready to form associations. Associations of forest owners are needed to overcome the structural disadvantages of private forests in terms of management and marketing possibilities and to intensify forestry extension activities with more effective outcome in a cost-effective manner.
The design of an attractive financial scheme supporting and encouraging owners to form forest owners' associations may be needed. Expenses of the government for this purpose will result in savings in the actual extension work.
The system of 'Voivod' governors being in charge of forestry extension, and the commissioning of the actual task to the State Forest Enterprise, is complicated. In addition, the remuneration of the State Forest Enterprise for carrying out the task is insufficient. Under these circumstances, the State Forest Enterprise is not motivated, or obliged, to 'do a good job'. Responsibility and financial means for the execution of forestry extension should possibly be more appropriately united.
The 'Voivod' governors could still hold a strong position in controlling the use of finances, through their participation in the design and formulation of annual forestry extension work plans for 'Voivods', and the monitoring of their implementation. The principle function of 'Voivod' governors should be the political mobilization of the state budget for the support of forestry extension.
Under the present circumstances, it appears that the State Forest Enterprise would be interested in dropping forestry extension from its activities. Then forestry extension could be merged with the existing system of agricultural extension, or the job of forestry extension given to independent, private forestry extension agents.
Regardless of whether the existing institutional framework of forestry extension is improved and strengthened, or whether other solutions are favoured and developed, the insufficient training of forestry extension personnel should be tackled. The problem has to be approached by differentiating between the training of present professional generations and the education of future generations of professionals through developing the curricula of training institutions.
Forestry research is in need of funding to carry out urgently required research. Poland is applying for European Union (EU) membership. The EU already overproduces in certain areas of agricultural and there will be no need for the continuing agricultural management of low productive farmland, which in many cases is already lying fallow. Forestation of low production farmland is certainly a solution. However, private owners of such low production farmland need regular incomes, year by year, from their land and not only in the long term. Agroforestry systems could fulfill the objectives of forestation in the medium- and long-term and regular, annual income generation in the first few years after forestation. Immediate establishment and monitoring of on-farm research trials is required to develop extendible results as soon as possible.
Silvicultural research and demonstration of forest management systems, suited to the individual needs of private forest owners, is required. Regular, annual income possibilities from small forest property can be developed through the transformation of even-aged stands into multi-layered, Close to Nature stands combined with selective felling methods. Income from forests could also be increased through the development of non-wood forest product research. Most of all, forestry research will have to carry out research on the economics of private forestry, including the establishment and management of a permanent monitoring system of the economic situation of private forests. Research could contribute toward the first step in the improvement of management skills of private forest owners through assessing their training needs.
On the basis of assessed training needs, a training programme for private forest owners should be developed, including required information, teaching and training materials.
A public relations programme could be used to promote the value of private forests, and the important role of private forest owners. Increased self-esteem of private forest owners might raise the level of interest shown in their forest property. Public relations would, at the same time, raise the expectations of society towards private forest ownership, which would then mobilize the necessary political and financial support. Increased self-esteem, and interest of private forest owners, expectations of society, and political and financial support will increase the motivation of private forest owners to participate in training programmes, collaborate with an extension service and to practice sustainable forest management.
It is felt that the present situation of forestry merits a review and the development of a complex, modern forestry extension system. The Forestry Department of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and Forestry is potentially interested in regional cooperation with its neighbours, to exchange experiences and ideas on forestry extension development and to receive training of trainers on forestry extension.

Forest cover
Forests cover 6 380 000 ha, 27% of the total area of Romania. Previously, 70% of the present-day territory was forest covered (Chirita, 1986). Sixty-six percent of the forests are found in the mountains (30% of the country), 24% in the hilly regions (37% of the country) and 10% on the plains (33% of the country).
Forest composition is varied. Conifers make up about 30%, beech (pure and mixed stands) 30%, oak species 19%, various hard broad-leaves 14% and soft broad-leaves 6%. A 'natural forest' composition model is the main goal of present-day management plans. From 1960-1985 inappropriate native and introduced coniferous species were planted, resulting in ecological problems in artificial forest stands and low wood quality.
The average growing stock is 217 m/ha. In 1995 there was 0.27 ha forest area per capita. On average the total volume of harvested wood was 24-27 million m per year for 1951-1976. In 1987 the average growing stock was 22 million m, it was 14 million m in 1996 and the maximum volume of wood to be harvested for 1997, as approved by Parliament, was 14.8 million m.
Forest resources and management
Under the general management plan, renewed every 10 years, the main function of 44% of forests is to protect different ecosystems from soil erosion, pollution, and to create watershed protection (Function Group I). The main function of 56% of the forests is biomass production (Function Group II). Destruction by pollutants is serious in some industrial areas. It is estimated that 250 000 ha are heavily affected by pollution, and more than three million ha show foliar signs of pollution.
The first reference to forest protection was in the Constitution in 1907. However, in 1990 there were only 32 protected areas (25 000 ha). The development of the National System of Natural Parks and Reservations was initiated in 1990 (397 400 ha total, each park and reservation has 80% forest cover).
Forest ownership patterns
Previous forest policy transferred forest properties from private owners to the state. Establishment of state-owned forests began in 1863, with the transfer of forests owned by the Bucovina monasteries to the state. In 1871, these were managed by a Technical Council for Forest Administration. In 1939, forest ownership was as follows:
 30% state-owned forests;
 29% private forests; and
 41% community forest.
In 1946 it was:
 24% state-owned forests;
 30% private forests; and
 46% community forest (Dinu, 1939, Sabau, 1946).
By 1948, 100% of the forests were state-owned. Between 1954-1986, the local community administered 500 000 ha of state-owned forest. Under Law 18/1990, private ex-owners of forests received one ha of forest per person. The result is the current forest-ownership pattern - 6 030 000 ha of state-owned forest and less than 350 000 ha of private forest owned by more than 600 000 people.
The average private forest property is 0.52 ha. An important part (38%) of these forests are included in Functional Group I (forests where the main function is protection). Here, wood harvesting is restricted for ecological reasons. Also, private forests are grouped into small forest areas - overall 21 000 private forest areas out of which 22% have less than one ha, 36% 1-5 ha, 16% 5-10 ha, 19% 10-50 ha, 0.004% 50-100 ha, 0.001% 100-200 ha and only 0.005% have over 200 ha, making efficient private owner management of forests extremely difficult. Approximately 15% of the private forest owners organize together to better manage their forests. In 1996, there was no community-owned forest property.
The policy statement for the future aims to maintain current forest ownership patterns, assure the integrity of present-day private forest areas and to form owners of small forest properties into associations.
Historical precedents to forestry extension
Romania's history and civilization has continuously been linked with the forest. The first regulations governing forest management were issued in the 18th century, then in 1843, by Mihail Sturza in Moldavia and in 1847, by Alexandru Stirbei in Vallachia. In 1851, after the establishment of the first Silviculture School in Bucharest, led by three French foresters, these regulations acquired practical importance. The French forester group, together with young Romanian students and foresters, constituted the Forest Commission of Vallachia between 1851-1853. Their main focus was forest management.
The first forestry code, issued in 1881 stipulated continuity principles in Romanian forestry, and the necessity of having skilled forest administration and management personnel for state-owned forest property (created in 1863). This led to the foundation of the Silviculture Special School in 1883 in Bucharest.
The Progresul Silvic Society, a non-governmental association of foresters founded in 1886, has lobbied continuously for forestry extension, and tried to influence forest policy to provide sustainable forest management. Important Romanian personalities have become members of this Society to promote forestry extension principles.
The Society also organized symposiums, workshops and seminars to promote civic awareness in forestry, as well as a yearly 'tree-planting activity'. The foundation of Progresul Silvic Society and its Forest Journal, 'Revista Padurilor', in the same year were the most important events in Romanian forestry. The Forest Journal collection is the best synthesis of Romanian forestry.
The first professional school of forestry was founded in Branesti in 1894, and the first mid-level forestry school was founded in Timisoara in 1919. The first instructions for forest management issued in 1923, aimed at unifying the different regional management plans and the Law of Forestry Education. Three levels of forestry education were stipulated - lower level (Vocational Forestry School), mid-level (Medium Forestry School, Timisoara, Pantelimon and Herastrau) and graduate level (Silviculture Section of the Technical Institute, Bucharest).
From 1953 until 1990, forestry higher education was concentrated in Brasov. After 1990, new forestry faculties were founded in Suceava and Oradea. An Environmental Engineering section was founded in Timisoara at the Faculty of Hydrotechnics of Technical University. Private, higher education in ecology is developed in Bucharest, Timisoara, Arad, Deva.
The Forest Research Institute was founded in 1933 to provide solutions to specific problems found in Romanian forests. The first results of the Institute were the establishment of natural and taxonomic studies on the main native forest tree species, forest soil studies, identification and description or forest tree parasites, contributions to natural regeneration in oak forests, seed analysis methods, nursery methods for the culture of forest species, methods of afforestation of low production lands in south-eastern Romania (Dobrogea), techniques of forest windbreaks in flat plain areas and biometry studies for acacia and spruce.
In 1948 only 39% of forests were managed according to management plans. Beginning in that year a national system of forest management was developed and is continuously being updated and improved. Forest management plans consider the evolution of intermediate forest structure and its multi-use function in order to harmonize management objectives and results.
The main characteristics of Romanian forest management are:
 evolution towards multi-use forests;
 functional repartition by forest zone (1956) in accordance with the present-day concept of sustainable forestry;
 the systemic conception of forest management;
 the integration of forest management plans into a more complex framework concerning environment management;
 maintenance of natural composition in forests;
 the utilization of natural regeneration;
 maintenance of a high-level rotation age for native forest species;
 utilization of adequate treatments to maintain the ecological balance;
 emphasis on natural forest structure;
 utilization of selected systems for appropriate situations and functions (Zeletin and Armasescu, 1953); and
 the sustained increment method annual growth, corresponding to actual forest structure (Carcea, 1959, 1986).
The Forestry Code of 1996
The current forestry code was adopted by Parliament 4 April 1996. Renewal of the 1962 forestry code was considered, but dismissed. The new socio-economic situation, the appearance of private forest property, the need to rehabilitate degraded forest stands and the need to create a legal framework to emphasize the importance of forests in the ecological balance called for a contemporary plan.
Points stressed in the Code include:
 the total forest vegetation mentioned in the Forest Management Plans, both state-owned or private property, constitute the national forest area. Under the Forestry Code/1996 a forest area is defined as an area larger than 0.25 ha and covered with forest trees;
 the current forestry code refers to forest vegetation not included in the national forest area as forested pastures, forest windbreaks, forested low production areas, forests for watershed protection, community forest parks, dendrologic collections, forest tree alignments and the alpine vegetation with Pinus mugo;
 the State, represented by the Central Public Authority, currently the Ministry of Waters, Forests and Environment (Ministry), issues forest policy and oversees forest management;
 the responsibility of Romsilva RA (the government forest management organization) is to provide sustainable forest ecosystems, to preserve biodiversity and to ensure the multi-use functions of the forests; and
 national forest area is managed in terms of the silvicultural regime (system of technical, economic and legal norms/regulations issued by the Central Public Authority). Implementation of the forestry code is directed by the Central Public Authority.
Romsilva RA, founded in 1990, is supervised by the Ministry of Water, Forests and Environment. It manages state-owned forests and is organized into three administrative levels.
 The Center, headed by a general manager (120 members);
 41 County Branches - the 42nd Branch, the Institute of Forest Research and Management (ICAS), consisting of three combined research and management stations, three forest research stations and four forest management stations (1 000 members) with five pilot forest districts; and
 400 forest districts, managing 10 000 to 25 000 ha each.
The Forestry Code/1996 specifications
A forest management plan is drawn up for a period of 10 years (except for poplar and willow forests, renewed every five years) for each 'production unit' of the local forest districts. Forest management plans are issued in accordance with the general management plans of the territory to maintain sustainable, multi-use forests. Forest management plans are the responsibility of the Institute of Forest Research and Management and private companies under its direction. Every forest management plan is supervised by the Ministry, and modifications can be made only with the acceptance of the Central Public Authority.
Under the Forestry Code/1996, there are two functional forest classifications:
 Group I - protects the environment and serves recreation and conservation needs; and
 Group II - for biomass production and environmental protection.
Forest management applies the multi-use framework of the silvicultural system. For Group I there are four distinct functional types of forest:
 the first prohibits any silvicultural treatment or tending work, concerns only National parks and Reserves;
 the second, allows harvesting of only small amounts of wood. The aim of managing such a forest is not wood production but to preserve the forest canopy. Thinning is allowed according to the slope of the terrain, i.e. thinning is not permitted for slopes exceeding 35 degrees. This functional type is ascribed to stands covering small areas where selection systems cannot be applied;
 the third type is closely related to group selection and irregular shelter-wood systems. Very intensive protection functions require an uneven-age structure obtainable only with a slow regeneration process. This type is a common subject of discussion between foresters advocating selection system promotion and those who maintain that group system is the proper treatment to be applied; and
 the fourth type is a compromise between economic and ecological goals and any treatment regime could be applied in accordance with common criteria.
Forest management features stipulated by the Forestry Code are:
 high-forest regime to ensure sustainable forests. The coppice regime is allowed only in poplar and willow forests;
 species consistent with natural forest composition used for natural regeneration and forestation;
 clear-cutting only in pure stands of spruce, pine, acacia, poplar and willow for areas smaller than three ha. Natural regeneration or forestation of these areas within a maximum of two years;
 temporary transfer of forest areas may be accepted;
 the seed and planting stock used in forestry must be certified;
 the health of forests must be assessed annually and Romsilva RA has the responsibility of maintaining the ecological balance;
 the allowable cut is established annually by the government;
 logging activity should not damage the forest ecosystem beyond a certain limit (although the Forestry Code/1996 does not clearly specify this limit);
 Romsilva RA has the authority to buy low production lands or accept donations from owners for reforestation, and administrate public low production lands; and
 plant material and technical assistance costs necessary for the reforestation of low production lands is funded by the state budget.
Management Plans are issued every ten years for most forests, and every five years in poplar and willow plantations. A production unit could be formed by two or more management series, incorporating similar stands from the productive and protective viewpoints. The only condition for its establishment is related to the minimum area considered for a sustainable yield according to the main species life-cycle and its proper silvicultural treatments. A separate allowable cut is determined for each management series. From an administrative viewpoint, the stand is the lowest information unit and is called the management unit and one or more stands form a compartment.
Determining the allowable cut
The current method used to determine the allowable cut is based on a traditional sustained yield approach. The method aims to maximize the forest increment. The algorithm used to determine the allowable cut takes into account rotation length, average species composition, forest structure according to site indices, and the existing distribution of age classes.
Rotation length is calculated according to the maximum rent principle. This is compatible with the fact that the national forest estate is a state property, with annual expenditures and revenues. Small areas enter and exit this estate. Maximizing the rent is a more reasonable goal than maximizing land value. Rotations have been set according to the average increment of the target dimensional class, and reflect a conservative policy with an environmental dimension.
Private forests
The administration and management of private forests is done by private owners themselves on the basis of local forest management plans. Provisional technical norms, the same as those for state-owned forests, have recently been issued (July 1996) by the Ministry. Any forestry activity in private forests must be supervised by the local forest district of Romsilva RA. All land owners in Romania can reforest their own land without restriction. This concerns harvesting and commercializing the wood (Forestry Code 68/1996).
Features of state support of private forests include:
 local management plans are funded by the state budget;
 reforestation of private low production lands is carried out by Romsilva RA and supported by the state budget allocations or by a special fund for low production lands;
 reforestation of clear-cut private forests, within a maximum of two years, is an obligation of private owners. Technical assistance is provided by Romsilva RA. Where reforestation is not carried out within this two year period, Romsilva RA districts will undertake reforestation and the private owner is obliged to pay the costs;
 in the case of natural disasters occurring on private individual forest areas, Romsilva RA will provide technical assistance and planting material free of charge;
 Romsilva RA provides pest control and prevention at no cost; and
 under the Law 83/1993, the state budget pays for planting material used by private owners to forest their own low production lands.
A user fee system is mentioned in the Forestry Code/1996, as a possibility of private forest owners obtaining benefits but rules and norms have not yet been issued.
Long-term goals for the state-owned forests
The Ministry of Water, Forests and Environment, Romsilva RA and the Forest Research and Management Institute created the Strategy of Forestry Development in December 1995, designed specifically for state-owned forests.
The current institutional structure is to be maintained. The Ministry assures the legislation and the control of forestry, and Romsilva RA is in charge of forest management at the national level. These plans will be renewed every ten years and the Institute of Forest Management Planning will oversee the process.
Long-term goals focus on:
 the maintenance of the integrity and development of the public forest estate; and
 the preservation of private forests.
Ecological objectives aim at:
 the conservation of biodiversity of natural forest types (over 150 000 ha of genetic resource reservations, 350 000 ha of protected areas, special attention for endangered species in forest ecosystems);
 the extension of the present-day forest area (reforestation of 10 000 ha of low production lands and 2 000 ha of low-production farmland is planned for the next five years);
 specific forest and hydro-technical works for flood control (financial resources limit investments in the short term to 600 km);
 technical development of forestry to provide sustainable management of forests (in accordance with current international requirements);
 continuous expansion of the use of natural regeneration (50% by the year 2000 and 60% by 2005) and improved structural complexity of forest stands;
 the ecological and economic reconstruction of degraded forests (50 000 ha/year);
 the intensification of forest protection and safeguarding activities through the establishment of a Center for Biological Methods in Forest Pest Prevention and Control;
 forest health assessment by a European Integrated Monitoring System; and
 the provision of sustainable forests through forest management planning.
Structural adjustment objectives in the forestry sector are to:
 optimize the administrative structure;
 promote the forestry information system;
 improve forest technology;
 promote privatization in forestry for specific forestry activities, such as forest roads, production of planting material, or through the association of private companies and forestry administration units (state-owned forests) to improve the value of forest products;
 improve the financial system through the development of timber extraction from state-owned forests, export of timber and other forest products, and new taxes for various forest benefits in special areas;
 maintain the current administrative organizations for specific research activities, or divide the Institute of Forest Research and Management into a National Institute of Forest Research and an Institute for Forest Management Planning, both under supervision of the Ministry; and
 create a National Center for Continuous Professional Training for Forestry under Romsilva RA and a new organizational system for mid-level, professional training of forestry personnel.
Legislative objectives include:
 development of private forest management norms; and
 renewal of technical norms defining the forestry regime and forestry personnel status.
Strategy concerning private sector
The Strategy contains a few general principles on private forestry extension in Romania:
 maintenance of private forest integrity (approximately 5 000 ha were deforested soon after privatization, especially in the south, Oltenia region);
 encouragement of the growth and sustainable management of multi-use private forests as stipulated in the Forestry Code and specific technical norms and regulations;
 integration of the local private forest management plans into a holistic view at the national level; and
 maintenance of the current forest ownership pattern with the goal of creating forest owner associations by geographical region.
Research and the private sector
The only research project on the topic of private forestry in Romania, completed by the Institute of Forest Research and Management, has proposed several variants for private forest management:
a) Private forests are managed by the local forest districts of Romsilva RA. - Private owners receive the corresponding usufruct for the owned area. This represents the value of the annual growth, from which costs for specific forestry activities, performed by Romsilva RA, is deducted. This method is considered the best for private individual forests where owners, including ex-owners family members do not live on their land. This includes approximately 80 000 ha of private forests owned by 150 000 people.
b) Simple management plans have been made for private forests integrated into Romsilva RA production units:
 forest districts, specifically delimited in the field and managed according to the norms, for state-owned forests;
 simple management plans taken from the local management plan for each private owner;
 specific rules for wood harvesting; and
 the minimum requirement of a ten year period of cooperation between private owners and Romsilva RA forest districts.
c) Production sub-units - Private forests are managed as production sub-units having the following areas:
 minimum 250 ha for high-forest;
 200 ha for selection system;
 50 ha for coppice.
These are based on local management plans and on the technical norms for state-owned forests. Management studies and plans will be undertaken for each private forest production sub-unit based on the forest management plans. Services for specific forestry operations (network) can be provided by the local forest districts of Romsilva RA. The minimum period required for cooperation between Romsilva RA forest districts and private owners is ten years.
d) Management series - If the area of a private forest sub-unit falls below the limit required, it will be included as a management series in the territory of the forest districts. A management study will be issued for each management series based on the local management plan.
e) Private forest associations - Associations must have a minimum of 50 ha of forest and will be managed on the basis of management regulations issued by the Institute of Forest Research and Management or certified private companies.
f) Individual management of private forests based on simple management regulations - The management plans will be issued at the local level and contain a brief description of forests, total wood volume; annual possibility and recommended forestry operations.
Education of forestry professionals in forestry extension
Formal forestry education in Romania is organized as follows:
University level
 Faculty of Forestry at Brasov University;
 Faculty of Forestry at Suceava University;
 Faculty of Forestry at Oradea University; and the
 Forest College at Brasov University.
Postgraduate level:
 Center for Continuous Training for Forestry Personnel, Busteni.
Ph.D. training courses:
 Faculty of Forestry, Brasov and Academy of Agriculture and Forest Science-Bucharest.
Mid-level:
 Technical School at Timisoara, five high schools and up to 10-12 vocational training and instructional establishments for foresters.
Some forestry extension topics are already included by education and training institutions. Specific subjects on extension are distributed between current disciplines. Knowledge acquired in school by forestry personnel is considered adequate for the management of current small-holding properties.
Training of private forest owners
Presently, specific training programmes or courses for private forest owners do not exist in the educational system. Private owners are not ready to invest time and money for training because they manage small properties having a maximum of one hectare. There are also few private owner associations and these are only in their beginning phase. Only recently have these associations considered the training of personnel.
Governmental association
The Ministry of Water, Forests and Environment, through its Forest Department, coordinates forestry extension and issues technical guidelines. The Institute of Forest Research and Management draws up forestry laws and provides regulation enforcement together with the Romsilva RA.
Romsilva RA administers and manages state-owned forests, issues forestry law and regulation enforcement, monitors technical assistance and service activities in private forests. The Institute of Forest Research and Management, as a branch of Romsilva, issues technical guidelines and instructions for forestry. Financial assistance is provided by the Ministry of Science and Technology and, in some cases, from the Academy of Agriculture and Forest Sciences. Management plans are also issued with financial assistance from the state budget.
Some private companies headed by forest engineers, who are ex-employees of the Institute of Forest Research and Management, issue forest management plans, under the Institute's guidance. Forest Month, March - April is organized every year by the Institute. This event is advertised in the mass-media. Professional contests are also organized annually. The distribution of the weekly Journal of Romsilva RA 'Our Forest' is limited to forestry personnel, and public impact is minimal.
Non-governmental associations (NGOs)
Since 1990 numerous environmental organizations have been founded in Romania. Most of these organizations focus on local problems and their activities are not particularly relevant to problems of forestry extension. The exceptions are Progresul Silvic (PS) and the Romanian Association of Ecological Management.
The Progresul Silvic Society (SPS) was created to provide a free flow of information between specialists on improved management of Romanian forests. The main goal of SPS has always been forestry extension. The society's objectives are to:
 promote the implementation of research results in the management, conservation and harvesting of forests and the general development of forest science;
 protect Romanian forest resources;
 discuss and propose strategies for hunting and fishing activities;
 promote and inform the public on new advances in forest science and the accumulated experience; and
 support and encourage the education of young people for a forestry career.
Presently, SPS has more than 1 000 members, comprised mainly of foresters and retired forest engineers. Their experience is passed to young people during workshops, seminars and field trips. The organization has local country branches and publishes the Forest Journal, Revista Padurilor, founded in 1866. Between 1945-1989, SPS was forbidden, but its spirit was maintained by foresters. Some Romanian and foreign personalities are 'honourary members'. Active local branches are organized into regional branches which publish semestrial or trimestrial publications such as Prosit-Timisoara for the western region, Bucovina Forestiera-Suceava for the northern region and the Forestry Journal-Brasov for the central region.
The Romanian Association for Ecological Management, is quite new and lobbies for the introduction of fair price for timber, and on other forest products, and some aspects of the multi-use role of forests. This organization can provide funds for forestry extension.
Financial arrangements for forestry extension
Following a government ruling, one percent of forest enterprises' budget must go towards research and development. In practice the level of financial support for this activity is far below this level because of other governmental priorities. This causes difficulties in sustaining good forest management. An adequate level of investment is required for forestry research and development.
Under the Forestry Code/1996, Romsilva RA will create a special fund for forest conservation and regeneration from the following sources:
 the market value of areas removed from the forest estate;
 compensation for damages to the forest estate;
 market value of losses through the exploitation of trees before the specific fixed rotation age;
 taxes paid for favourable effects of forests on the environment;
 20-25% from allowable cut value; and
 allocations from the budget.
Required forestry operations and safe-guarding of all variants presented above can be provided by local Romsilva RA forest district personnel and paid for by private forest owners.
Forestry extension goals and examples
Based on current ownership patterns, existing institutional arrangements, and the legal framework, forestry extension in Romania has a limited chance of effectiveness.
The tradition of private forestry and forestry extension in Romania has been ignored for the past 50 years. Forestry has been considered a threat to agriculture due to the need for new farmland and pastures, and was therefore given little priority.
Both agriculture and forestry were managed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry during the last 50 years. Beekeeping, silkworm culture and cattle-breeding were imposed on foresters. Production ran according to the central plan. Heavy penalties were enforced on those who could not fulfill the provisions of the plan, regardless of local conditions.
The training of forestry extension personnel
The training level of forestry personnel is considered adequate for present needs. There is a tradition of 110 years of education at the university level with three forestry faculties and five forestry high schools. These can be used for the development of forestry extension activities. The training system could be revised at the high school and post graduation level. Education and training should be continuously improved. Specific training in forestry extension is required.
Training for private owners in forestry extension is non-existent. A campaign is required for its promotion. In 1995, more than 100 forest engineers graduated and many forestry high school graduates remained unemployed. Having acquired professional skills, they can be trained as forestry extension specialists.
Ecology graduates of private universities are a special consideration. In 1990, the private education system was unexpectedly developed. The number of private ecological universities has grown since 1993. After the first graduation, in 1994, the graduates were deemed insufficiently trained and their diploma is not yet recognized by the authorities. Companies and organizations lacked interest in employing graduates. Confidence in these universities decreased and their future remains uncertain.
The current legislation permits the employment of extra personnel for local forest districts where there is a requirement for private property management. All specific extension problems are supervised, or solved by, the existent forest district personnel who are adequately trained for these problems.
Direct interaction with forest owners
Dialogue between practicing foresters and landowners is necessary for forestry extension implementation. This depends on a foresters' professional and communication skills. The long-term economic advantages to owners and the multiple benefits to society need to be emphasised. Owners should understand that forests are valuable and a secure long-term investment due to their continuous production. It is important to explain to forest owners that current wood prices will probably increase four to five times in the near future.
Mass media
National television is perhaps the most valuable tool in transmitting any message in Romania. The impact of any present-day televised message is enormous. Radio and newspapers may also be valuable tools in transmitting information and promoting the interest of the people in forestry activities. Current television and radio programmes are insufficient for this purpose. Documentaries, presenting forests multiple benefits to society should be broadcast at prime time.
An important subject for private forest small-holders is the correct evaluation of their forests - often understood narrowly as the value of existing wood. Many of these small-holders intend to cut the forest in order to obtain an immediate profit. Forestry extension activities must be motivated by long-term economic advantages.
Summary
The forest has occupied an important place in the history and culture of Romanians. A 100 year tradition in forestry, and economic pressure starting in the 18th century, led to a conservative management system. So far, no radical changes have been made in Romanian forest policy after 1990, as the forest is managed as a public asset.
During the six year transition to a market economy, the main forestry reforms have been privatization of the forest estate and a new forestry law, Forestry Code/1996. With respect to the managerial background, the situation stands as it was in 1985. An environmentally sound managerial system has been established in order to promote indigenous tree species, natural forests, biodiversity conservation, long rotations and silvicultural systems based on natural regeneration.
The method used to establish the allowable cut remains the same. The present situation in forestry, however, is troubled by the lack of interdisciplinary research, misunderstanding of the real problems of forestry extension by officials, unsuitable allocation of financial resources and the lack of a flow of information between the research sector and the main-user.
Three laws are important, from the forestry point of view. The Law of Land, Law 18/1991 which created an important private sector in agriculture and a private forest sector as a secondary result, the Forestry Code/1996, which mainly addressed public forest administration and Law 83/1993 that referred to subsidies for reforestation of private, low productive lands. The role of agencies in the implementation of the laws, as stipulated in the Forestry Code/1996, must be clarified.
There seems to be a politically-motivated reluctance to changing the property structure of the forest estate, and to restoring all private property rights. The rhythm of economic reforms, institutional improvements and the lack of consistency with the environmental policy reflects this attitude. Supporting evidence includes:
 the restoration of private forest properties, limited to one hectare per owner/family. This inhibits long-term forest management in a free market economy due to insufficiently trained forest owners;
 both the Water Law and Environment Law neglect the role of forests in maintaining water and air quality, as well as the carbon sequestration function;
 a centralized system to set floor prices for auctions (the starting price for various species and dimensional classes) does not consider local conditions; and
 enforced low prices for planting material used in extension activities means that costs are not covered, resulting in diminishing interest in its production. As a consequence there is not enough available planting material for extension activities despite the demand.
Romanian forestry is composed of the Forest Research and Management Institute, which is the main governmental institution involved in forestry extension. Romsilva RA, its main user, is also its superior administrative level. Some current research programmes have not clearly addressed some specific technical and economic weak points of forestry but are drawn up as university subjects. The Institute has its own pilot forest districts but their role in effective extension is still very poor.
The current system of local forest districts directing forestry extension is questionable. There is no obligation or motivation for forest districts to promote forestry extension, and there is no control that forests districts fulfill these functions.
The three forestry faculties in Brasov, Suceava and Oradea are not yet involved in extension activities, in spite of their important capacities in the field. This is another consequence of insufficient competition for research contracts, as inappropriate extension did not stimulate demand for research and low demand was directed to the Forest Research and Management Institute.
In addition to personnel trained in forestry, extension activity requires intensive training for forestry personnel and for forest owners. Extensive training of future personnel should begin in the first years of school. Teachers, in primary and secondary schools, can provide an important base from which to promote extension principles to the next generation. Results can be obtained by using mass-media (especially television).
For suitable management of private forests, owners must have economic motivation. The possibility of obtaining various long-term economic advantages from harvested wood must be explained to the forest-owners. The complex role of forests in providing benefits to society must be emphasized. International workshops and seminars on forestry extension are necessary, but there is also the need for direct interaction among extension personnel, forest owners and politicians, experienced in other countries. The Society Progresul Sylvic, as a non-governmental organization, with highly qualified forestry personnel among its members, may play an important role in forestry extension at the field level.
Financial resources for future forestry extension, as stipulated in the Forestry Code/1996 (the special fund for forest conservation and regeneration), could be sufficient for developing good extension. Forestry extension is only theoretically considered among the current problems in Romania. The promotion of forestry extension has not yet made a relevant public impact. In the future Romanian forestry extension must be reviewed in order to improve its institutional framework.
Main problems encountered in connection with forestry extension are:
 insufficient information on forestry extension;
 insufficient separation between forestry extension and the institution in charge of management of state-owned forests;
 forestry tree seedling price is fixed artificially low, and does not cover production costs;
 lack of experience in private forestry;
 the price of wood (approximately $US54 m);
 700 000 ha of state-owned, low production lands; and
 present ownership patterns, especially the large numbers of owners and relatively small size of holdings.

Forest cover
Forests cover approximately two million hectares, or 40% of the Slovak Republic. Of these, about 60% are state forests and 40% non-state forests. Of the latter, more than 50% belong to associations. The remaining are private, municipal and church forests.
Although forests are concentrated in a small area, a wide range of original tree species have been preserved. Broad-leaved species predominate in the lowlands and hill territories of the south and east. There are mixed forests, with coniferous species dominating, in the mountains of the central and northern areas. In the mountainous areas, mixed stands of spruce, fir and beech prevail.
Forest ecosystems are stable. There are untouched areas, containing many original species of fauna and flora. Populations of brown bear, lynx, wolf, golden and lesser spotted eagle, and otter exist and, in the alpine region, marmot and chamois.
Forest resources and management
Forests are important for soil protection and water management. A network of protected areas has been created to facilitate nature conservation. Some of these are comparable to the best preserves in Europe.
Before the recent development of nature conservation institutions, foresters practiced nature conservation. The first protected area was designated at the end of the last century. This was followed by Tatra National Park, in the High Tatras in 1949. In 1955, under a new nature conservation law, other areas were classified as protected areas and national parks.
There are five national parks covering 200 000 ha or 4% of the area:
 Tatra National Park;
 Pieninsky National Park;
 Low Tatras National Park;
 Small Tatra National Park, and
 Slovak Paradise National Park.
A further 16 protected areas have been designated (660 500 ha - 14% of the Slovakia's territory), 448 state natural reserves (91 500 ha), 104 protected natural areas and 228 protected natural parks. These protected areas and protection zones represent a total of 28% of the Slovakia's territory.
The long-term effects of civilization have damaged the equilibrium of ecosystems, especially that of forest health. This is also true of protected areas. In addition to the negative impact of pollution, abiotic and biological factors; management policy, of the late 1980s was often biased to short-term economic benefits instead of proper forest management. To reduce the cost of cutting and transporting wood, these processes were industrialized and forest biological systems were sometimes compromised.
Original tree species composition has changed through many years of management. The proportion of spruce and pine has increased and the distribution of fir, beech, and oak has been reduced. Trends can be illustrated by comparing tree species composition in 1920 and today. There is an increase in spruce and a reduction in tender fir, which, until recently, was the most productive tree species.
A priority for Slovak forests is the achievement of a desirable target composition for tree species. The 'Lesoproject Zvolen', a survey institution founded by the Ministry of Land Management, developed the first version of a target composition based on ten years of research and forest site mapping. Scientific substantiation and formalization has been carried out by the Forestry Research Institute Zvolen, 'Lesnicky vyskumny ustav'.
The policy of target tree species composition is based on the basic principals of forest management - maximum, permanent, safe and effective performance of forests' both in the public interest and for forest production.
The following ecological principals are applied in the target composition of tree species:
 biodiversity protection, i.e., the cultivation of mixed species stands and tree species suitable for forest sites;
 alleviation of the effects of pollution and other harmful factors by using more resistant tree species; and
 elimination of one-sided, unbalanced utilization of sites through altering the proportion of highly productive tree species with the addition of other tree species to preserve sustainable development and for ecological reasons.
The following economic principals are applied:
 where the composition of tree species is suitable for the site, the proportion of commercial tree species is increased (spruce, larch, oak, and valuable broad-leaved species);
 silviculture aimed at increasing tree species' quality and obtaining larger diameters (in the south, broad-leaved species and in the north small-dimensioned coniferous species); and
 wood production oriented to the utilization of wood for its unique properties, i.e., towards mechanical (and to a lesser extent, chemical) wood treatment.
Currently, the aim is to preserve fir on suitable sites, to increase the share of larch and of valuable broad-leaved species and to increase resistance to pollution.
Economics of forestry
The volume of wood harvested is decided on the basis of a balance between exploitation and sustainable forests' production. Annual harvesting for the future has been calculated at almost. 4 500 thousand m, from this 3 300 thousand m wood is produced from end of rotation cuttings and 1 200 thousand m from intermediate cuttings.
Cutting and delimbing are carried out with power saws. The average time for these two operations is 1.01 hr/m. Trees are delimbed mainly where felled. Timber is skidded to the roadside by whole-stem logging. As much as 93% of the timber is hauled by tractors, mainly by special forest haulers. Three percent of the cut wood is hauled by cableway and about 4% by horse. Assortments are produced from stems using power saws in forest depots. About 24% of the assortments are produced in central mechanized conversion landings, or in customers' mechanized depots - app. 3% of the volume of wood cut.
Recently, wood chipping technology has been introduced and mobile chippers used. Chips are produced from the crowns of trees. Techniques for timber transport are adjusted to the method and place of assortment production. Assortments are transported by haul rigs, equipped with hydraulic booms, with a carrying capacity of 12 metric tons. Hauling sets, with a carrying capacity of 27 metric tons, are used for stem transportation. High-capacity extensions and containers with a volume of 25 m are used to transport chips.
Timber-transport time (from site to consumer) is on average 4 hr/m. Mechanized logging activities require the appropriate opening up of forests by a system of hauling and skidding roads and lines. Presently, there is 11 m of hauling road per hectare. Five m/ha are paved roads used year round, and 6 m/ha are seasonal roads, good for trucks. Haulage roads and lines amount to 30-50 m/ha.
The domestic wood processing industry utilizes almost 97% of the wood cut. The share of wood consumption, in individual sectors of the wood-processing industry, varies according to tree species composition and qualitative structure of the wood cut. Approximately 3% of softwood and almost 7% of hardwood cut is used for the production of veneers, ply-woods, matches, and other special wood products. Approximately 69% of softwood and 36% of hardwood is used in the lumber industry. Approximately 23% of softwood and 48% of hardwood is used for cellulose, chipboard and fiberboard production. Approximately 5% of softwood and 9% of hardwood is used for energy purposes.
Until 1989, forest management evolved in the framework of a centrally planned economy. State forests (including military forests, school forests and forests managed by the Ministry of Industry) were 99% of the total forest area. The forest sector made up 0.5-0.7% of the Gross Domestic Product, and was dependent on the development of industry. The forestry sector employed 36 000-42 000 people, 2% of the economically active inhabitants of the Slovakia. Presently the State forest organizational management structure is being modified.
Forest land was managed by forest enterprises, commercial organizations, directly connected with the state budget. Financing and budgets were centrally planned. Benefits from production activities (92% from wood products) were unable to cover costs and forestry was subsidized (and still is today) by the state budget. After 1991, state funds for forestry assistance have been utilized by offering subsidies. The top rate of subsidies has been reduced to approximately one third.
Until 1990, timber trade and prices were governed centrally by state regulation. This period was characterized by price stability, with moderate increases. Since 1990, timber prices have increased 2.5 times. Until 1990, export was regulated by the state and after 1990 by license policy. Timber export represented a maximum of 22% and a minimum of 3% of wood production.
Analysis of the restitution process
During the past 40 years the majority of private forest land became state owned forest administration entities, regardless of ownership rights. Although recognized, ownership rights were denied. In 1990, the Declaration of Parity helped solve this problem. The Act on Regulation of Ownership Rights to Land and other Agricultural Assets, Land Regulation Act (Act 229/1991 Coll.), govern issues relating to forest land.
The implementation of the Land Regulation Act is complicated by the complexity of forest ownership rights. Not only must rights of ownership and usage be returned to the original owners, new conditions must be created to assist new owners to manage their forest property.
The Municipal Assets Act (Act 306/1992 Coll.) governs the restitution of ownership title to the municipalities. These rights were nationalized in 1949. The Act on Redressment of Property Wrongs committed to Churches and Religious Societies governs the restitution of assets (Act 282/1993 Coll.).
As of July 1995, a total of 66 681 owners have applied for the restitution of their ownership and usage rights to forest land. The total forest area amounts to 1 989 000 ha, the area applied for by former owners is 919 400 ha, 46% of total forest land. As of July 1995, a total of 10 540 requests have been approved and the ownership title or usage right transferred for 701 900 ha representing 34% of total forest area and 76% of the area requested. Returned forest land is owned by:
 Associations of owners (2 408)
383 000 ha
 Municipalities (182)
176 500 ha
 Religious organizations (337)
41 900 ha
The applications submitted by individual owners are more difficult to fulfill. As of July 1995, ownership and usage rights were returned to 16% of the individual applicants (39% of the area requested). The area to be returned, either for ownership or usage rights, amounts to 217 600 ha, representing 56 141 applicants, of which 124 663 ha are to be returned to 37 785 individual owners.
When preparing the legislation, the specific features of forestry, such as the long production period and its impact on costs and profits, were not taken fully into account. Many heirs of the original owners, live away from their property and have no experience of forest management or are unable to provide professional management. On the other hand Forest Management Associations are not interested in leasing properties which may not be profitable.
The Act made restitution of small size properties to several joint owners possible. In many cases these areas do not amount to more than 0.50 ha. These properties can not be identified because the owners do not have ownership documentation. Under the Land Regulation Act, forest land is returned to the owners. In the case of small areas, it is returned in integral parts. It is presumed that the owners will associate and jointly manage the forest.
The intention of the government was to restitute the whole forest and not to become involved in solving disputes regarding property boundaries. The owners, however, consider this approach a new 'nationalization' of their property and those who consent are mainly the owners of less profitable forests. The State decided to help these 'integral forest parts' owners and consider them as priority receivers of grants from the State Forest Improvement Fund. Tax relief would, however, be of more help to them.
The Act on Measures to Regulate the Ownership Rights to Land (Act 180/1995 Coll.) and the Act on Land Associations (Act 181/1995 Coll.) have brought about improvement and acceleration of the forest land restitution process. The Slovak Government passed a resolution on 10 October 1995, to accelerate and to remove defects related to the above mentioned process. Defects will be eliminated in the restitution Acts related to forest land when the new legislation is approved. Specific features of forest property and its rational management shall be considered.
State administration
The Ministry of Land Management, Forest Section handles government administration of forest management and hunting. The Ministry addresses strategy and policy issues of forest development, legislative conditions and contacts with other branches of the economy. There are six regional forest offices in the Slovakia, that supervise compliance with legal regulations, approve forest management plans, declare protection and special purpose forests.
There are 33 forest offices that supervise forest activity, accept and approve work in forests. These offices also issue decisions, approvals, exceptions and follow selected economic information.
State owned enterprises
The State Forest Administration Agencies manage the state-owned forest land. The agencies provide all the forest management services, such as seed purchase, planting, tending of stands, including the felling and sale of wood. The Ministry of Land Management coordinates four Headquarters, each of which is responsible for 8-10 Forest Management Agencies (the total number of Agencies in the Slovakia is 36). The Forest Management Agencies also handle restitution of forest land to the original owners. However, this land may be used by the agencies only to the extent necessary for improving the state of the assets under restitution, for example tending, cutting and other services derived from the Forest Management Plan, other than principal felling.
In 1989 there were 52 Forest Management Agencies in the Slovakia. The number of the Agencies dropped to 40 in the course of the ownership and usage rights restitution. After another two years, the number reduced to 36. At the conclusion of the forest management transformation process, there will probably be 30-32 agencies.
State-owned resource development strategy
The changes at all Forest Management Agencies will consist of the revision of the management structure at the Headquarters level and at the Agencies and District Forest Administration bodies. The new organizational structure shall be a prerequisite for stabilization of conditions, in case of fluctuations in prices on the wood market and for reduction of the non-productive overhead management costs. It will be necessary to harmonise new organizational units activities according to internal management rules. This will make it necessary to complete the establishment of a high quality information system at all management levels.
To give more authority to lower level organizational units, many of the powers shall be delegated to Forest Management Sub-agencies and District Forest Administration bodies. The new forest management organizational structure is a tool to create operative entities representing public interest, characterized by:
 balanced accomplishment of environmental tasks and maximum exploitation of production capacities;
 a high number of professional staff;
 financial independence;
 promotion of public interest for management of non-profit forests;
 equilibrium between profitable and non-profitable services within one entity; and
 competitiveness and capacity to face market fluctuations.
Reorganization is taking place gradually, to consider natural reduction in administrative staff at the Central and Sub-agency bodies. The changes, in organizational structure of the Forest Administration Agencies, have been implemented to move gradually towards new management conditions and to reduce costs. A decrease in the number of staff means a savings of app. ($US 1 million).
Private forest resource-development strategy
The conclusion of the restitution of forest land property and usage rights to the original owners is the first necessary requisite for stabilization and development of the private forest management sector.
Several forest owners associations have been established in the Slovakia, and private forest owners voluntarily become members. Of these the Slovak Private Forests Owners Association is dominant. Established in 1991, in 1995 it had more than 670 collective and 1 700 individual members. The members of the Association administer around 550 000 ha of forests, 78% of the total restituted forest area. The Ministry of Land Management discussed the methodical guidelines, amendments to the Acts and principal questions concerning cooperation within private sector development with this Association. The Association representatives are members of the State Fund for Forest Improvement and the Advisory Council at the Ministry of Land Management. Other associations include the Slovak Forest Land Owners, with 150 participants throughout the country who participated in the General Meeting held in 1995 and the Association of Municipal Forest Owners, established in 1995. More than 75
municipalities owning forests also took part at the constituent General Meeting. The common goal of the Associations is to collaborate with the State Administration bodies, organize consultation, promote grants and subsidies from the State and give assistance on research into a new model for the incorporation of the private forest management sector into the existing forest administration.
Two methods were proposed by the Ministry for the administration and development of private forests. The first is to impart direct instructions on the management and administration of forests through the Institutions which are directly controlled by the Ministry (Forest Project Office, Forestry Research Institute, District Forest Administration).
The second provides professional guidance and guarantees state supervision of compliance with the legislation. In the latter case, the Ministry may influence the private forest indirectly, through laws, taxes and subsidies. Slovak forestry management requires a combination of two methods - direct and indirect control of private forests.
The prerequisites for the implementation of this system are to:
 establish, through a new act to be approved by Parliament, representation of private forests owners at the highest level (Chamber of Private Forests Owners);
 extend, within the existing Forest Administration Act, the power of District Forest Administration, with consulting services, or to create the professional Forest Managers if appropriate;
 direct forest policy (taxes, feed, grants, subventions) in a way to influence private forest owners to act in compliance with strategic and conception goals set for overall forest administration;
 promote further education so that forest owners understand the basic principals of forest administration;
 establish volunteer associations of private forest owners;
 establish an association of private entrepreneurs operating in the forestry sector; and
 establish wood commerce associations.
The proposed, private forest resource-development strategy, may be a good base for an official strategy. This requires a more profound analysis of the economic conditions of private owners. The proposals made by the Forest Division, to consider specific features of forest administration activities and to adjust the tax legislation, have not been fully taken into account.
Historical precedents to extension
As a result of a decision taken by the Emperor Maria Terezia in 1764, the Academy of Mining and Forestry was founded in Banska Stiavnica. In 1807, the Academy of Forestry separated. In 1824, the Forestry Institute, the first of this type in the world, was established and foresters throughout Europe came to study. An independent Research Forestry Institute was also founded in Banska Stiavnica at the end of the 19th century.
The Central Forest-Research Station was established in 1898, where, along with the classical disciplines of forestry, exotic wood species were introduced and grown. In 1900, an Arboretum was established for these purposes in Kysihyble near Banska Stiavnica.
The Forest Order of Maria Terezia had prompted the planting of wood species in the free areas near towns and villages. It also ensured creativity in the forest economy and lead to the start of forestry education at the Academy of Mining in Banska Stiavnica in 1770. The Forest School in Liptovsky Hradok in 1795, was the first such school in Hungary at that time and played a significant role in Slovak education in forestry until 1815.
It proved desirable to establish an institution at a higher academic level having a scientific orientation. The Institute of Forestry, that formed part of the Academy of Mining in Banska Stiavnica, was used for this purpose from 1807. It performed, at the same time, the function of a training institution for the education of forestry specialists.
Professor Henrich David Wilkers, the founder of the Institute, gave most of the lectures on natural history and forestry. He was also engaged in scientific research, and became the pioneer of the modern science of forestry in the Slovakia. He cooperated closely with the most distinguished personality in Slovak forestry and an outstanding forest economist, the wood-reeve for Banska, Bystrica, Joseph Dekret Matejovie who had reached a high European standard through new, practical forestry techniques. He had became well-known due to his research and design of artificial renewing or economic management of woods.
The professional training and education of employees in the forestry sector is based on the traditional values of Slovak forestry and on the experience of many generations of foresters. The training of forestry staff for forest administration is ensured by both Ministry of Education and Ministry of Land Management.
Education provided by the Ministry of Education
A forestry education is provided by the Ministry of Education through the Faculty of Forestry at the Technical University in Zvolen (university studies). Presently, the university has three faculties: Forestry, Wood Technology and Ecology. The course lasts for five years and graduates are awarded a degree in engineering (M.Sc.).
A three year programme is offered at the Faculty of Ecology. Graduates are awarded a bachelor's degree. Studies for employed persons last six years. Studies consist of forestry and applied ecology. The specialization studies at the Faculty of Wood Technology include wood technology, enterprise management, construction of forest and wood technology machines and equipment and industrial furniture design. The Faculty of Forestry consists of the following departments:
 Natural Environment
 Phytology
 Silviculture
 Forest Protection and Game Management
 Forest Engineering and Improvement
 Forest Exploitation and Mechanization
 Forest Management and Geodesy
 Physical Training
The university is unable to admit all students interested in these studies. The applicants must pass entrance examinations.
The Technical University also provides a three-year graduate programme for scientific workers. Studies are completed after the acceptable presentation a doctors thesis. Graduates are awarded a PhD. The Technical University provides the courses in forest phytopathology, silviculture, landscape engineering, plant protection, forest management, enterprise economic theory and agricultural management, forestry and woodworking enterprises, technology and mechanization of agricultural and forest production, forest zoology and ecology, technology of wood processing, structure and properties of wood, construction and production processes for wood products. The Technical University has been authorized to award a doctor of sciences degrees (Dr Sc.) in forest environment science, silviculture and wood technology.
Significant components of the University's work are science and research. These have been oriented towards basic and applied research directed towards fuller utilization of forests, complex wood processing and ecology.
The development of the research base, increased efficiency of the pedagogical process, research activity and practical teaching of students are greatly supported by the special-purpose establishments of the university.
The Technical University has a well-equipped Institute of Computing Technique which ensures the operation of computers and the development and operation of information systems. The employees of the institute also take part in pedagogical and scientific work.
The School Forest Enterprise controls more than 7 800 ha of forests and, with the exception of production, provides practical instruction to forestry students. The Development Workshops and Laboratories instruct students of wood technology, furniture development, devices and research equipment. Most of the activities of the Development Workshops is economic aimed at the realization of research.
The Borova Hora Arboretum, 49 ha, represents a basis for pedagogical and research in the specialization of forest dendrology and silviculture.
The Slovak Library for Forestry and Wood Science fulfills the needs for study materials and information and is, simultaneously, a specialized scientific library for employees in forestry and woodworking.
The graduates of the Technical University work in the production organizations of forestry and wood working industries. Numerous graduates have worked in development and project institutes, in nature protection organizations, research institutions and in state administration.
The education of secondary school graduates is provided by three forestry secondary schools. The schools offer four years of full-time study, completed by an examination. Graduates should, after they have completed studies and a mandatory preparatory period, be able to deal with administrative tasks related to forest management, or to continue their studies at university. At present, forestry is taught following revised curriculum that take into consideration the needs of the private sector. Every year about 60 graduates leave the three schools, 20-30% are placed in universities, 10-20% as employees in the forestry sector, 20-25% in jobs corresponding to forestry education, 20-25% in other education provided at the infra-ministerial level.
The five secondary apprentice schools in forestry are linked to the Ministry of Land Management and the Ministry of Education of the Slovakia. The Ministry of Land Management established the schools, the administration and methodological planning. The Ministry of Education oversees the pedagogical and professional aspects. Course of study lasts for three years and includes theory, practical experience, professional training. The main subjects for specialization are for operators of machines and equipment used in forestry and forest machine equipment repair and maintenance. In 1994, the first class opened with 230 pupils. At present there are 750 pupils studying at the secondary apprentice schools in forestry. Students graduate after passing examinations in both theoretical and practical fields.
Education by the Ministry of Land Management
There is a system of permanent, or lifetime, education in forestry which complements the forestry education system. Continuous or permanent education is provided by the Forest and Water Management Education Institute. The Institute has the following tasks:
 training of top managers;
 preparation of professionals machine operators;
 training courses for administrative staff specifically for
 transfer of information into practice;
 training of examination commissioners and trainers for the education of forestry workers;
 private sector advisory services; and
 language teaching.
Other activities of the Institute, not directly related to teaching and training, involve preparation of teaching plans and curricula for agencies providing education and publishing activities. The Institute provides for the publication of manuals, guides and papers to satisfy the needs of all forestry management subjects.
Research and Forest Management
The Forestry Research Institute in Zvolen has programmes and archives on the following topics:
 seed research and nursery management;
 inventory;
 evaluation;
 policy;
 prognosis and conception of forestry planning and management;
 rationalization of technology procedures, and
 the economics of reproduction and genetic engineering.
Forestry management plans and policy are derived from the principal forestry management goals:
 to analyse the state of the forest, its production and exploitation capabilities, natural, social, technical, environmental and economic problems of management; and
 to monitor and evaluate the development of forests and to plan management so that the permanent continuous performance of all their functions is ensured, respecting the interests of both the public and the forest owners.
The Forest Project (Lesoprojekt) in Zvolen is in charge of forest surveying. It was founded by the Ministry of Land Management of the Slovakia. The Project's duties are as follows:
 implemention of ten-year, forest management plans, based on survey information. The analysis covers general information, the register of stand, stand description and plan of management measures, overview tables and time schedules, forest maps and is substantiated with documentation.
 creation of a summary on which to base forestry management plans;
 provision of expertise on surveying, evaluation of forests and reimbursement of losses;
 database monitoring of the state and development of forest resources;
 ensuring forest management plans are developed and established;
 coordinating the management of computer technology in forest management; and
 provision of consultation on the application of forest management plans.
Forestry extension goals and examples
A separate institution for forestry extension has not yet been established in the Slovakia. There is no formal forestry extension, as it is performed in other countries, and there are no courses conducted on this subject. Mass media is not utilized and there is only one monthly magazine which focuses on the non-state forestry sector, 'Forest', published by the Ministry of Soil Management in collaboration with the Forest and Water Management Education Institute.
A type of formal extension is provided by professional forest managers, by the state administration and its employees, and by the Association of forest owners. Interest was expressed by forest owners mostly in the process of restitution, ownership and usage rights.
Management aspects have been neglected, possibly due to the lack of a sense of owning property, accumulated over the years under a centrally planned economy. Forest owners have sometimes satisfied their short-term needs, in violation of the Forestry Act, and the basic principles of sustainable forestry. Instability has also been introduced by the presence of timber sellers who default on payments to forest owners. With the introduction of related laws and safe-guards the conditions will be created for more stable and regular trading in wood. The role of non-wood products is minimal, due to the past administration when the society focused on wood being the main forest product.
It is especially important to create associations of private forest owners, to increase effective information flow. A forestry manual published yearly would fill this need. It should contain the following information: the wood market, wood re-sellers, dealers in forest machinery, means to protect forests, wood processing industries, harmful agents and methods for their control, and practical advice directed towards increased efficiency of forest work. The association or the Chamber of Private Forest Owners would be responsible for its publication.
The unification of forestry research, education and extension could be successful and viable. This depends on the approach taken by the founder, the Forestry Research Institute. The State has an interest in protecting forests, while forestry extension is for the benefit of forest owners, directly or through the associations. Problems faced in establishing forestry extension would be mostly financial.
The Forestry Protection Service is based on a long tradition and the experience of the Research Station at the Institute, which has good facilities, personnel, buildings, equipment, vehicles. Forestry research in the Slovakia is focused mainly on fundamental forestry with attention being given to socio-economic and policy issues. There is less focus on the issue of forestry extension. However, the Forestry Research Institute could analyse the basic principles of forestry extension in foreign countries, for possibly introduction to local conditions.
Associations of forest owners act as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) where owners associate voluntarily. Funds necessary for their activities are raised in the form of fees paid by the members; if there is a special project, the associations strive to obtain funds from various sources, including the government.
The professional forest manager, is to some extent, an 'extension officer'. The managers job is to take care of the forest, however, and they do not and have not been trained to do forestry extension. Their education does not include markets or economics. Their functions are regulatory in respect to the fulfillment of the management plan. Communication and extension skills are not required to pass the certifying examinations. Exams consists of questions regarding legal aspects, forestry acts, and forest care, protection, cutting, silviculture, timber, transport, forest establishment.
State (Ministry of Land Management) participation in financing the activities of forest owners' associations is not yet clear. There is a specific advisory institution: the Forestry Protection Service, under the control of the Forestry Research Institute. It provides advisory services on forest protection issues (insects, defoliators, rots, forest pathology) and methods for their control. Advice is provided to all forest owners on request.
New legislation, on the amendments of ownership rights, has brought a new element to forestry issues: the professional forest manager. This is supposed to be the principal element for sustainable forest development. The Act 15/1994 states that it is the duty of forest owners to hire a professional forest manager to administer forests on their property. The manager must have a: university degree in forest sciences and five years of practical experience or secondary school degree and ten years of practical experience, and they must pass examinations in both theory and practice before an examination board. The law does not specify whether the profession of forest manager is required for the private sector only. Therefore, it is assumed state-owned forest employees must also pass the examinations (Chiefs of Forest Districts).
The professional forest manager (also applies to the private sector) is responsible for:
 preparation of basic documents for the elaboration of a forest management plan;
 supervision, direction and fulfillment of the plan;
 control and registration of work performed in the forest;
 monitoring the state and the development of injurious agents in the forest;
 preparation of proposals for forest management plan amendments upon request; and
 determines methods of planting, tending of stands, harvesting and timber transportation.
The development of Forestry extension services in the Slovakia might be seen in two stages.
Stage 1 - prior to a full-functioning private forest sector (around 2000). The transformation of forest ownership rights should be completed in 1998. Courses could be implemented in 1997 for forest owners to train them to administer their forest without a professional forest managers. After passing exams in both theory and practice of basic forest management owners should be entitled to administer their own forests. As the services of a professional forest manager are not free, this could provide an incentive to owners to learn to manage their own forests. A major concern is for forest owners (individual or joint) who administer forests up to 100 ha. These owners will be responsible, according to the balance as of 1998, for the administration of app. 330 000 ha, 38% of total private forests, or 17% of Slovak forests.
Forest owners who do not take part in courses or do not pass the examinations will continue to be assisted by a professional forest manager. In addition to mandatory courses, supplementary education (provided by the Forest and Water Management Education Institute) could assist with specific needs owners face in their own forests (forest protection, forest establishment, silviculture). The courses would be voluntary and the cost covered by the state (prior to the establishment of the private sector in 2000).
Stage 2 - after the establishment of the private forest sector. After 2000, the goal is that private forest owners will be experienced in forest management. Economically, forestry extension can be administered by the lowest state control and supervisory body - the Forest Office. This office should employee around 15-20 employees. Currently, this figure is around five employees per office. The provision of advisory services should be stipulated in a government act. State sector training facilities may be used for long-term training courses (at the Forest and Water Management Education Institute). This must be agreed upon by the Chamber of Private Forest Owners and the Institute. The costs of the courses organized by the Institute shall be borne by the private sector. A second option is for the Chamber of Private Forest Owners to establish its own advisory center (for forestry extension) located in the Regional Forest Offices. However, this second option is financially and
logistically difficult for the private sector.
Summary
Social changes after 1989 have influenced forestry structures in the Slovakia. New laws and ideas have been detailed, taking into consideration world and European trends and the conclusions of the most important international negotiations. In particular, the conclusions of the Conferences of Ministers on Protection of European Forests in Strasbourg and Helsinki should be noted. On this basis, the Strategy and Conception of Forestry in the Slovakia and the State Forestry Policy have been accepted, new laws and other important documents have been approved by the Government and National Council of the Slovakia.
The information provided is in full compliance with the goals set by countries with a developed forestry extension plan. The main strategic goal of the State forestry policy is to protect forests and provide for their permanent development, to preserve forests, and ensure protection and improvement. As per the Programme of the Slovak Government from January 1995, the basic documents: Strategy and Conception of Forestry in the Slovakia and the State Forestry Policy, should be revised and amended in 1998.
The Forestry Section at the Ministry of Land Management shall ensure the ecological aspects of forest administration, within the limits of sustainable development, and take into consideration in all the new documents at the national level. The Section, preparing a proposal for new legislation to come into effect in 1998, will be presented as complex Acts - codes, not to over regulate the situation during the economic transformation period, but to help stabilized conditions in the country.

Forest cover
Forests in Slovenia cover 1 094 000 ha or 54% of the country, ranking Slovenia among the most forested countries in Europe. Slovenian forests are diverse and have an average growing stock of over 200 m per hectare. Conifers dominate on 30% of the forest area, mixed forests on 40% and broad-leaved forests on 30%.
Forest resources and management
Ownership structure of Slovene forests
After the 'denationalization' process in Slovenia is complete, 80% of forest land will be privately owned, distributed among nearly 250 000 forest land owners. The state will own approximately 15% of forest lands. The remaining 5% will be owned by communities, the Catholic church and various cooperatives. The proportion of non-farm forest owners will increase. The average size of private forest property will be smaller, but there will also be larger, private forest holdings. The proportion of public forests will be comparable to that in Norway and Austria which have, besides Portugal, the smallest proportion of public forests in Europe.
The ownership situation (there are approximately 250 000 forest owners in Slovenia) renders forest management in private forests difficult, but favours biological and structural diversity. For owners with small holdings, the forest's significance is decreased and interest in the cultivation of a high-quality forest is minimal. In addition, owners are usually unqualified to perform forest work. A small ownership structure also means that district foresters have to cooperate with a large number of people, making forest extension difficult. Most owners will not respond to media promotion or attend educational events or programmes. This type of owner is easier to reach through personal contact with a forester. This makes forest-extension work time consuming. It also makes extension work difficult, as the typical knowledge level of owners is lower than if blocks were larger and cared for by owners with sufficiently large holdings to have a vested interest in improving their
knowledge level, skill in implementing forest management operations, and acquisition of suitable equipment.
Forest management in Slovenia is based on Close to Nature Forestry (CNF). Using CNF principles, Slovenia's foresters strive to ensure that the ecological, social and economic functions of forests are fulfilled harmoniously. CNF has a proven record for, and continuing tradition of, combining conservation of nature with economic gain. Over the long term, application of CNF principles is, therefore, considered to be advantageous to private owners' interests and to the ecological stability of the countryside.
Forest management in multipurpose forests is more complex than that solely for wood production. Silvicultural measures must be planned, temporally and spatially synchronized, and activities must be carefully implemented. The CNF orientation encourages use of natural regeneration and only moderate, small-scale interventions. Clear-cuts are not used in Slovenia, thus there is always a residual stand that must be left undamaged.
Historical precedents to extension
Pre-World War II
There is a long tradition of sustainable forestry in Slovenia. Within the boundaries of present-day Slovenia, a series of forest ordinances were issued. The first, the Ortenburg Forest Ordinance, dates back to 1406, (Anko, 1985a), and regulates hunting rights.
Wood became important in the 16th century when many mines and associated industries appeared. Forest ordinances from that time tried to assure protection and maintenance of forests that provided necessary building timber for mines, fuel for blast-furnaces and forges, as well as for water rakes, bridges and rafts on which iron and salt were carried (Anko, 1987, 1989).
The first forest management plans were made at the end of the 18th century. An original method for assessing forest growth and managing uneven-aged stands was developed in Slovenia, the Control Method, that allowed for understanding forest development qualitatively and quantitatively. This method has been in use for more than a 100 years in some parts of the country.
The Forest Ordinance for Carniola, issued in what is now the central part of Slovenia in 1771 (Anko, 1985b), was an important step forward in terms of disseminating the technical knowledge required for successful forest management. This ordinance can be considered a foundation for modern forestry extension in Slovenia, and was translated into Slovene about 1824, and published in a periodical for farmers and craftsmen in 1849.
The Forest Ordinance for Carniola, also called the Theresian Forest Ordinance, was written to assure better forest management in a situation when forests were degraded, mismanaged and the shortage of wood acute. Its restrictions were binding on all who had the right to use forests, but especially for lords who were expected to provide a good example to bondsmen, as it was anticipated that bondsmen would adopt the practices used by the lords.
The Carniola ordinance was based on the rule that for each forest the yield should be estimated and the amount of wood the forest can sustain determined. In this ordinance, were also precise regulations concerning regeneration and cutting techniques, including the preservation of saplings, the optimal time for cutting and use of different tree species and forms of timber, as well as a ban on using forests for pasture, a ban on building fires in forests, and instructions on how to combat forest fires.
In 1853 farmers, who had previously only had rights to cut timber for their needs in the forests of lords, became forest owners. By 1873 their individual holdings combined accounted for 52% of the total forests in present-day Slovenia. An additional 8% of forest land was in common village property, 30% was held as private estates, 6% was church owned and 4% were owned by the state. Some exceptional foresters were employed by the owners of the great forest estates, e.g., Hufnagl in Koevje, Schollmayer in Snenik, but there was a lack of professional support in farm forests.
In the second half of the 19th centuary timber prices rose, due to better transport conditions and new markets, farm labour rose concurrently. As a result, farm forests were over-exploited. Many farm forests were completely over cut. Under such circumstances the Society of Foresters of Carniola and the Littoral decided to publish a manual entitled: Instructions for managing small forest properties (Guzelj, 1903), hoping this would improve the situation.
Another important forestry text-book was published just after the first Forest Act was adopted in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, of which Slovenia was a part after World War I. The text-book, Farm Forestry (Miklavzic, 1933), contained a broad range of general information intended to help farmers manage their forest sustainably. The chapters covered:
 how forests live and grow;
 forest functions and their significance;
 threats to the forest;
 cultivation and exploitation of farm forests - (a) artificial regeneration, (b) silvicultural systems, (c) forest tending, (d) advice for harvesting and selling timber;
 important regulations from the Forest Act for every-day-use;
 seven cardinal sins for a farm forest; and
 forest supervision, regional forest referees, forest nurseries and other matters.
The socialist period
After World War II, about 20% of private forests were nationalized, Nevertheless, two-thirds of Slovenian forests were still privately owned, the average private forest holdings were reduced to half the size they were at the beginning of the century (Winkler, 1995).

Immediately after the war, new regulations obliged farmers to sell timber to the state. In the 1960s, farmers were compelled to be members of cooperatives engaged both in agriculture and forestry. In the 1970s, cooperatives were separated into two categories - 'forestry only' and 'agriculture only'.
The forestry cooperatives were incorporated into 14 management enterprises. Following forest management plans, foresters employed in these enterprises marked trees for felling in both public and private forests. In private forests, owners retained the right to carry out all operational silvicultural activities, felling and skidding. About 65-70% of the selling price of timber was paid to forest owners. Remaining revenues were used to pay staff salaries, finance transportation, road construction and maintenance, and provide funds for silvicultural activities.
Under the system, many foresters tried to work with and educate forest owners, in a kind of ad hoc extension work. However, as owners felt repressed by not being able to make their own decisions on the sale of forest products from their land, the relationship between foresters and forest owners was strained. The management system collapsed in the late 1980s when farmers began to sell timber on their own. This experience was, however, retained by foresters. The potential for the success for one-on-one engagement with owners, where policy-level decisions are not contrary to the efforts of field level personnel to promote sound management, was duly noted.
The Forest Act of 1993
A new forest act was adopted in 1993 in the newly established Republic of Slovenia. It derives from the new constitution which mandates that private property rights be fully respected. Nevertheless, the 1993 Forest Act restricts use of private property. Section 5 of the act states, "the rights of ownership to forests shall be exercised in such a manner as ensures their ecological, social, and productive functions. The owner of a forest must therefore:
 manage the forest in accordance with regulations, management plans and administrative acts issued on the basis of this act;
 allow free access to and movement in the forest; and
 allow beekeeping, hunting and recreational gathering of fruits, herbal plants, mushrooms and wild animals in accordance with regulations."
Under the Forest Act, forest management plans are made for all forests irrespective of ownership. All forests must be managed within the limitations and guidelines of these plans. Owners of forests, however, have the right and are encouraged to participate in preparation of forest management and wildlife management plans. Their needs, proposals and requests will be respected as much as possible, consistent with ecosystem limitations and legal restrictions.
An important feature of the Forest Act is the provision that forest owners can utilize their forests after obtaining an administrative order, issued by the Slovenian Forest Service (SFS), on the basis of a silviculture plan, and after prior consultation and joint selection, e.g., the forester, together with the landowner, of trees for possible felling. The order describes: required silviculture work including planting and tending of saplings and thicket stages, required protection work, the structure of trees to be harvested, guidelines for felling and hauling timber and the time period for which the order is valid.
The importance of this, from the perspective of extension, lies in the fact that every owner must contact the forester before beginning work. In this contact, foresters can convey a great deal of information to the owner and subsequent work is typically performed to a higher quality level than would otherwise have been the case. The disadvantage of this systems is that more foresters are needed as individual contacts are time consuming.
An additional negative consequence of the requirement for landowners to obtain an administrative order prior to implementing work is that this requirement can be perceived as a distrust of land owners, which is especially unfortunate where they are well-educated or well-qualified to do their own forest work. Given the uncomfortable relationship between foresters and landowners during the socialist period, described earlier, it is highly desirable to move towards approaches that rely on positive inducement, and in which foresters respect for landowners is not suspect. In spite of such concerns it is significant that there have been few complaints by landowners since this system was implemented. Thus this system, and therefore the opportunity for foresters to engage landowners one-on-one prior to the implementation of work, will remain intact for the foreseeable future. Personal contacts between foresters and landowners will continue as an important component of Slovenia's
approach to extension.
Forestry extension goals and examples
The important factors that determine Slovenian's approach to extension derive most evidently from:
 the ownership structure of forest land;
 the national goals for Slovenia's forest land, reflected in the CNF emphasis prescribed in the Forest Act;
 the legal structure mandating landowner contact with foresters prior to the implementation of work in forests; and
 the lessons foresters learned from past experience, especially that economic and ecological benefits of forests must be addressed together, and sociocultural sensitivity should be shown.
Farmers
It is important to note that farms have not only a production role but also a social role, and are important for maintaining the cultural landscape. Thus, the development needs of farms has a social value and must be respected when setting goals and measures for the management of farm forests.
A pre-eminent extension need among farmers is the need for improved safety in harvest extraction techniques. Slovenian farmers have more accidents and fatalities during harvest and other forest management activities compared to other European countries (Medved, 1994).
Direct contacts with farmers are maintained by district foresters. It is more efficient for district foresters to interact with farmers as their holdings are typically larger, foresters make return visits more frequently and the rapport between foresters and farmers is better. Additionally, the skill and knowledge level of farmers is high. Thus, one-on-one interactions, in conjunction with the foresters other duties, are an effective way for information to be transferred. Farmers can also be reached more easily, because of their generally greater interest level, through workshops and classes, where topics of current interest, and state-of-the-art techniques and equipment can be demonstrated.
Practising foresters
Managing forests is a complex and demanding task that can be successfully accomplished only by forestry experts. Continuing education of practising foresters is essential to maintaining high standards of forest care.
A particularly important recent programme, arising because of the additional education requirements demanded of foresters in the 1993 Forest Act, is the continued education of district foresters. District foresters, who had only finished forestry high-school, were required to enter the Forestry Faculty at the University of Ljubljana for an additional two years of study. Their continued education is important, especially because district foresters have direct contact with forest owners and prepare silvicultural plans, select trees for cutting, and determine silvicultural activities, all tasks for which a high proficiency in forestry is needed.
Additional goals of continuing education, since 1993, have focused in particular on improvement of the education of foresters, especially in the sense of broadening their communication skills, and preparation and implementation of a forestry extension programme.
Citizen groups
An important extension task for any country is educating young people to appreciate their natural heritage and understand what values can be derived from it. To this end, programmes aimed at school children, are deemed especially important. Additionally, numerous environmental and politically oriented organizations have interest in the forests and hence, forest management activities. Periodic programmes are provided for these groups.
Direct interaction with forest owners
Interaction with landowners is an important extension tool. This approach depends upon a dialogue between a district forester and a forest owner. A dialogue is compelled by law, as forest owners must contact district foresters when they decided to cut trees, and may themselves be contacted when district foresters notice that their land needs attention. The quality of the dialogue is largely dependent upon the technical and communication skills of the forester.
The groundwork was laid for this dialogue in the previous (socialist) system. In spite of some rationalization, most district foresters work in the same districts as they did before, and are well acquainted with local conditions. Many district foresters know many owners personally as well as the history of their forests.
In the dialogue with owners, depending on the situation, significant knowledge, skills and information can be transferred. The type of information conveyed is typically related to stand level, silvicultural and ecological interactions. It usually includes such things as the effects that the removal of trees could cause to forest diversity and ecological as well as social forest functions, principles of selection thinning, regeneration techniques and responses of different tree species to light conditions, the principles of overall stability of forest ecosystems, preventive measures against insects and diseases and the growth potential of the forest. Skills most frequently discussed are specific felling techniques, especially in the case of 'dangerous' trees, planting techniques and principles of tending young growth and thickets.
Additionally, there are provisions to provide owners with very specific management, organizational, economic and marketing assistance, advice and information. For example, when owners are farmers without suitable skidding equipment, the forester will help them determine which farmers in the area possess tractors, or other equipment, to do the job. The forester may also identify, if desired by the owner, which forestry enterprises interested in acquiring timber are active in the region. The forester can give owners general information on current market prices for different timber products. District foresters also take care to see that owners receive subsidy payments for work meeting the appropriate criteria.
Workshops, seminars and classes
Workshops and seminars are highly effective approaches, but presuppose a target audience sufficiently interested in attending them. As Slovenia has a large forest owner population that does not meet this criteria, care must be taken to both draw in these currently uninterested owners, while proceeding with programmes for those who are. Topics selected must address the interests of groups who will actually attend. One way to address the needs of interested groups is for forestry education to be more comprehensive, to include a new programme for forest owners and forest workers, as well as upgraded programmes for forestry experts. Extension is sufficiently important that subsidization is proposed to develop programmes adapted to the specific needs of forest owners. Many workshops are currently conducted each year under existing frameworks.
Mass media
Newspapers, radio and television are valuable tools to disseminate information about upcoming events or important information, such as changes in forest laws. They also can be used to generate interest in forestry activities, encouraging greater participation by owners and other relevant groups. Finally, well-prepared materials can inform the public about wildlife-forestry interactions and the importance of forest protection.
Governmental agencies
Numerous governmental organizations are active in conducting extension activities. Of paramount importance is the Slovene Forest Service (SFS), whose role is discussed below. The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry (Forest Department), the Ministry of Environment and Physical planning (Agency for Protection of Nature), the Fund for Farming Land and Forests of the Republic of Slovenia, and the Forestry Institute of Slovenia all work both cooperatively and independently in extension activities. Additionally, the Forestry Department of the Biotechnical Faculty at the University of Ljubljana is state-funded but operates with academic freedom and also is active in extension and continuing education activities, working independently and in cooperation with other organizations.
The Slovene Forest Service
With the 1993 Forest Act the Slovene Forest Service was established for the purpose of caring for all forests in the country. Its funds derive from the general budget of the Republic of Slovenia. Its main tasks are: monitoring the state and development of forests, making forest management and silviculture plans, educating and advising forest owners, deciding on administrative matters as a public authority and overseeing operational activities in the forest that are co-financed from the budget.
The SFS is hierarchically organized and has a central unit, 14 regional units, 94 local units and 430 districts. The SFS is managed by the director, but also has a council comprised of representatives of the councils of regional units, the founders (Government), educational and research organizations in the field of forestry, and forest owners. The council decides on forest and wildlife management plans, adopts the work programme for the SFS, determines financial transactions and approves its final accounts and reports.
The central unit coordinates the functioning of the SFS throughout Slovenia. The central unit prepares the programme of forest investments and activities needed, including the required subsidies to implement them. The central unit is comprised of five professional forestry departments:
 Forest and Forested Landscape Planning;
 Forest Protection and Silviculture;
 Forest Technology;
 Wildlife; and
 Forestry Extension and Public Relations.
Each of the first four departments is responsible for coordinating forestry extension with the regional units in its field of specialization. The Department of Forestry Extension and Public Relations, however, very specifically carries out extension work. These tasks include: monitoring conditions in the countryside, particularly of farms, monitoring relations with forest owners and the general public (public relations), influencing public opinion in connection with forests and forestry, collaborating with education institutions to promote knowledge of forest ecosystems and forestry among children, studying methods of communication and organizing related workshops for the SFS staff and publicizing the activities of the SFS.
Regional units of the SFS are a link between the central unit and local units. Compared to the central unit, regional units are in greater contact with the problems existing in each region and are more active in promoting forestry extension. Each regional unit consists of four sections with the same titles as departments 1-4 of the central unit, employing similar specialists.
The employees of the local units have direct contact with forest owners as well as other forest users. They are guided by forestry engineers who have broad ecological and forest management related knowledge and are able to respond to most problems related to forest issues in the communities. Everyday work with people and the forest, however, is done primarily by district foresters. Their areas average 2 500 ha.
The higher levels of organization of the SFS act to support the extension work of district foresters. Questions, more complicated than those typically handled by district foresters, connected with regulations, planning, forest policy or market situation are usually referred to forest engineers on local units. Forest engineers on regional units, however, may be called upon to explain to the owners very specific questions concerning road construction and maintenance, forest protection, forest technology, wildlife and hunting. Thus, within the SFS there is a comprehensive network of experts that can address the concerns of forest owners, using a strategy of initial contacts by district foresters, and then tapping additional expertise as needed.
Examples of extension activities in 1995
School groups
Foresters accompanied 28 outings into nearby forests for children attending kindergarten, and arranged talks about forests afterwards, illustrated by slides. Some of the trips were organized on forest nature trails which are maintained by the SFS with the help of sponsors, mostly forest enterprises and local communities.
Foresters participated in 170 nature days, dedicated to forests. The programme was enriched by on site lectures and explanations. They also organized 41 lectures on forests and accompanied 25 school trips into the forest. However, the most extensive work by foresters was to provide guidance on forest nature trails involving 471 school classes. Foresters also participated in the arrangement of school botanical gardens as well as in the organization of exhibitions dedicated to forests. SFS offered an award for the best drawing and the best article with a forest theme. School children were encouraged to prepare new forest nature trails together with foresters, and they participated in a regeneration project in a forest destroyed by fire.
Citizen groups
There were 325 events prepared for public organizations. The most important of these were guided excursions into Slovenian forests, attended by groups of foresters, nature conservation groups from abroad, or by tourists who were especially interested in virgin forests. Another important series of events were the presentation of forest management principles and the role of the SFS to mayors of local communities.
The mass media was used to disseminate information. During 1995 there were 42 radio and 12 television broadcasts made to the general public on forests and forestry. SFS foresters also wrote 133 forest related articles, predominantly for local newspapers. Concurrent to the permanent exhibitions on forests and forestry, arranged at some local units of the SFS, were several exhibitions of forest photography.
Forest owners
In the first years of the existence of the new forestry policy in Slovenia it was very important to inform forest owners of new forestry legislation and the organization of the SFS. A number of well-attended rallies were organized at which foresters explained the system of subsidies, forest management planning, and other matters important to forest owners. Much information was mailed to forest owners and there were 61 radio broadcasts on a variety of topics including some highly technical information on, for example, what to do in the event of bark-beetle infestation, ice-break, or other disturbances.
Bearing in mind that the number of accidents occurring while performing forest work in Slovenia is extremely high, especially among forest owners with small holdings poorly equipped for forest work, the SFS began to organize safety courses for felling trees and skidding. In 1995, eight such courses were held in close cooperation between the SFS and the Forestry High School which provided professional instructors. The courses were free of charge and were well-attended.
Forest owners also showed great interest in attending silviculture and forest protection courses. Since these are much less complicated to organize (only SFS staff were involved) they were more numerous than the tree-felling courses. More than 100 forest owners successfully finished this programme and received a certificate upon completion of the course. Foresters in the SFS also organized excursions into other regions of Slovenia for interested forest land owners. These excursions are very important for broadening the owners horizons and knowledge.
In connection with the courses described above the SFS published, together with the Association of Slovenian foresters, two handbooks. Ten thousand copies were printed. The first one was entitled, 'Tending and Protection of a Young Forest', and the second 'Tree-Felling Work Safety'. Both were well received. Current plans call for publication of a continuing series of forest extension handbooks.
Practising foresters
The SFS, organized more than 100 lectures, workshops and seminars for its staff, in cooperation with the University of Ljublijana, in the field of forest management planning, silviculture, harvesting, nature conservation, wildlife management, computer science and communication skills. Lectures were given primarily by specialists employed by the SFS. The communication training courses, and those on the organization of workshops, as well as other similar courses were conducted by specialized private firms.
Relationship between Slovene Forestry Service implementation and legislation
There is always a delicate balance between the rights of owners and the legitimate concerns of the public. Clearly this relationship was not satisfactory during the socialist period, at least from the perspective of the many farmers, generating bad feelings that persist to this day. On the other hand, given the highly fragmented ownership of Slovenia's forest land, without some government control, and government assistance, the outcome would likely be highly uncoordinated activities resulting in an unsatisfactory forest infrastructure, for example fragmented road networks, over-cut forests contrary to the long-term interests of the owners, and an environment unsatisfactory to the public. There is general recognition of the relationship between private and public interests in Slovenia, hence there is currently little danger that legislation contrary to the efforts of promoting sound forestry will be introduced or passed. The long history of Close to Nature Forestry in
Slovenia and the widespread approval of forestry as it is currently practiced, contribute to the favourable legislative environment within which Forest Extension is carried out.
Non-governmental organizations
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) act in several ways. Environmental NGOs stress the need for conserving forests and using them wisely. Marketing cooperatives and private organizations help forest owners sell their timber by providing them with timber exchange figures and organizing forest product sales.
Environmental organizations
While numerous environmental organizations exist in Slovenia, none focus particularly on forest management activities, preferring instead to direct their activities at such projects as ongoing plans for highway construction, the safety and operation of the nuclear power plant in Krsko, and pending plans for additional dams to supply hydropower. It is a testament to the quality of forestry practiced in Slovenia that there are no significant or ongoing disputes with environmental organizations.
Marketing cooperatives
Currently, there are around 160 cooperatives in Slovenia. Their activity focuses on marketing agricultural and forest products. Several conduct harvesting and silviculture tasks to a limited extent.
There are many advantages to cooperation between forest owners, primarily more efficient management in the form of combined efforts to facilitate implementation of forest management activities, including the construction of forest roads, competing for forestry projects subsidized by the state on the basis of tenders, marketing and selling timber, collecting and buying non-wood forest products, producing forest seedlings, decreasing the expense of forestry equipment, transfer of knowledge among landowners, and representation of landowner interests when conflicts with other forest users appear.
From an extension standpoint cooperatives offer the possibility of significantly improving opportunities to reach owners with small tracts of land. Extension approaches can shift from the emphasis on one-on-one interchanges as forest management needs are identified, to educational programmes and workshops aimed at groups with common interests. Where landowners can be persuaded to join cooperatives, extension can be more efficiently conducted.
Machine circles
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food supports owner efforts to organize machine circles where, well-equipped and qualified farmers offer services to neighbours. The extent of services for which no tax must be paid is regulated. This form of implementing forestry work is quite successful and spreading quickly.
Traditionally, more than 90% of felling and skidding was done by owners themselves, or their neighbours. Thirty-seven machine circles have been established, and have at the moment 1 500 members. These circles will formalize assistance among farmers and clearly define their standing in the forestry enterprises for taxation purposes. In addition, a catalogue of costs of agricultural and forestry services and equipment is now published every year. The prices of services between neighbours stated in this catalogue can prevent possible misunderstandings.
Forest landowner associations
Presently, the organization of forest owners is rather poor. At the national level their interests are represented by several political parties, however, their effect is diluted as these parties represent other interests as well. The Association of Forest Owners, whose property was nationalized after World War II, is active, but their activities are limited primarily to the denationalization process. Recently, following the Austrian model, an act was prepared that would re-establish the Chamber of Agriculture, organized also on a regional level. Conceptually, the members of the Chamber would represent the land proprietors and all agricultural and forestry enterprises. It is uncertain if the Chamber will really represent the owners' interests, however, as the enterprises could, in many cases, hold opposing views.
Costs and benefits of extension within the SFS
The cost of extension within the SFS is relatively high. It amounts to 12% of the total value of the timber cut in Slovenia. These costs are reasonable, however, when it is understood that in the long term the extension activity of the SFS should result in: lowering the costs of forest regeneration by enhancing the natural regeneration capacity of forest ecosystems, improvement of the quality of forest products by promoting thinning and forest tending, assuring the maintenance of ecological and social forest functions by keeping forest ecosystems stable and by improving their species and structural diversity. Additionally, very significant costs to society can be averted where accidents and fatalities are reduced on forest lands through increased attention to safety in forest activities. Thus, these funds can be seen as an investment in society and the ecosystems that sustain society, not as an expense.
Forestry extension activities aimed at providing information to owners with small holdings may result in their joining cooperatives. This would result in a gradual decrease in the number of SFS foresters required. This will promote further cost-saving in the long term. Many of the goals and practices of the SFS are aimed at better understanding the goals and practices of forest management and forest management planning. Thus, additional rationalization may also be reached in these fields, providing additional long-term savings. There will continue to be a need for permanent field-level foresters in both public and private forests. The question is only how many will be needed and which activities should be emphasized. The success of today's extension activities will have a bearing on this issue.
Incentives
The system of incentives is based on the conviction that forest owners who follow the management guidelines of the SFS, contribute to the stability of forests and to the fulfillment of ecological and recreational forest functions. These forest functions are beneficial for everybody, so tax-payers money is used to improve the management of private forests.
In the last two years of implementation of the incentives system it was evident that incentives were of crucial importance for achieving the goals of forest management. Forest owners, for example, who were not offered incentives during this time carried out only 8% of the required silvicultural activities. Owners, who were offered incentives carried out about 80%. It was also evident that forest owners were not only unwilling to invest in long-term silvicultural activities, they were also not prepared to share costs for extension assistance. The reasons are the general unpopularity of foresters that persists from the previous system and that agriculture and forestry are becoming less profitable.
Financing
Forest owners are responsible for carrying out all necessary activities in their forests. The public forest service is paid from the budget of the Republic of Slovenia, as well as a refund for reduced yield obtained from protection forests and forests with a special purpose. The following forest work is also subsidized:
Forest regeneration
 artificial regeneration;
 saplings paid in whole;
 natural regeneration, 30% of costs;
 forest tending, 20-40% of costs (or according to the terms of the public tender for thinning pole stands);
 measures against forest fire, up to 70% of costs;
 against herbivores, material plus 30% of other costs; and
 against diseases and insects, 30%, or materials plus 20% of other costs.
Maintenance of wildlife habitat
 30-70% of costs;
 renewal of depleted forests, according to the terms of public tender;
 forest renewal after forest fires and the rehabilitation or renewal of damaged forests - saplings plus 20% of costs;
 maintenance of forest roads, 35% of the cost; and
 investments (forest roads, plantations), according to the terms of the public tender.
The level of co-financing depends on the ecological and social functions of the forest, and on the difficulty of the natural conditions for agricultural and forestry production. Owners of more than 100 ha of production forest (there are very few such owners in Slovenia) are not entitled to co-financing.
Forestry extension work in the future will depend on the financing of the SPS, which has been criticized for being too large and costly. If the SFS survives, it will have to intensify its forestry extension work in organizing more courses and raising the level of interest among owners by inviting them to cooperate in the process of forest management and silviculture planning.
On the other hand, forest owners need to better organize themselves and cooperate to increase their effectiveness. It is increasingly obvious that prices obtained for some forest products do not cover costs. Innovative approaches and greater cooperation will be required to sustain the vitality of Slovenia's forests.
Summary
Successful forest management is costly, but has both public and private benefits. Informing land owners on efficient forestry techniques is a significant key to reducing costs. Slovenia's approach to extension is adapted to its unique pattern of land ownership and its commitment to multipurpose, sustainable forestry embodied by the Close to Nature approach.
Current extension informs forest owners about the possibilities and responsibilities associated with their forest land. Strengthening knowledge to assist forest landowners in the transition to a market economy, by adjusting practices to the present economic conditions, and gaining skill in marketing products, is another aim of forest extension education. Worker safety is a paramount concern and major focus.
District foresters, supported by a competent staff of resource specialists, will continue to be the first and most significant contact. Outreach to school groups will take on a greater role, as the duties of all of the newly restructured organizations are stabilized. Continuing improvement in the quality and quantity of continuing education will be increased, as cooperation between the Forest High School, the University, and the Forest Institute continues to develop.

Annex 1: Survey Form
Survey of private forestry and forestry extension activities in Central and Eastern Europe
The ongoing political, economic and social transformation in Central and Eastern European countries is affecting the forestry sector. After World War II, with the beginning of centrally planned economies, private forest ownership was almost entirely abolished. Many Central and Eastern European countries, now with democratic governments and market economic structures, are in the process of restituting forests to citizens, who owned forests prior to the nationalization (mostly after World War II) of private property. Economic considerations in some cases have lead to privatization of forest property. In other countries, some citizens, who had suffered from unjust treatment or loss of property are being compensated for these losses with forest land. As a result, a new private forestry sector, partly characterized by growing numbers of forest owners, is developing and creates a new set of tasks for the governments. It is of public interest that private forest owners receive
assistance from the government to manage their forest property sustainably. In countries with a long tradition of private forestry, a government supported 'Forestry Extension System' is providing this assistance in the form of e.g. technical, professional advice, information, incentives etc. The Forestry Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in the framework of its 'Regular Programme' is conducting a survey of the status of private forestry and forestry extension in Central and Eastern Europe to assist the FAO member countries in the Region in developing the capacities to ensure sustainable management of private and public forests. The Forestry Department of FAO, therefore, kindly requests that the following questionnaire is completed. The questions are only guidelines and should be completed where applicable. It is encouraged to attach any relevant, additional information.
