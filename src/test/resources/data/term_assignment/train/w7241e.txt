Foreword
Few can argue that energy is the basis of modem, urban life on this planet. The evolution of industrial civilization paralleled the increasing use of energy resources. After millennia of using wood, more efficient and convenient charcoal became the energy form of choice during the Middle Ages. Energy utilization took a giant leap forward when coal and coke began to fuel the furnaces of the Industrial Revolution. The powerful steam engines depended upon copious supplies of readily available fuel and coal ultimately became the primary source of industrial energy for the remainder of the 19th Century.
Although petroleum had been known for centuries and had been used for a wide range of purposes including medicine, commercial production did not begin until 1859. The original application for petroleum-based products was primarily lighting, but the convenience of an easily pumpable fuel quickly stimulated the development of the internal combustion engine. By 1892, small gasoline engines, powerful enough to run road vehicles had been invented. The 'age of the automobile' had begun and oil soon replaced coal as the dominant source of energy. Although the commercial potential of fossil fuels was known at that time, the extent to which we would become so dependent upon them was not.
This century has seen the world become a willing captive to an unsustainable future. The economically developed world is addicted to high energy consumption and global economic development will be reflected by the ever-expanding use of fossil fuels. The predicted growth in world population, supposedly peaking somewhere between 8 to 10 billion people will become a critical issue as the less developed countries of the world develop their economies and strive to enjoy their full and fair measure of the biosphere's renewable and non-renewable resources.
Since oil and coal are extracted from earth sources, supplies are finite and there are considerable concerns over the extent of remaining reserves. Far more significant for the quality of our life on this planet are the environmental problems associated with oil and coal utilization. Severe atmospheric pollution, acid rain and oil spills have defiled the world we live in to an unspeakable extent. Of even greater concern is the ceaseless buildup of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere and the potential warming trend associated with the Greenhouse effect. However, despite the dual oil price shocks of 1973 and 1980, total CO[2] emissions into the atmosphere increased by more than 40% in the two decades between 1970 and 1990. It is a pattern we seem incapable of controlling.
The struggle we face in the future will not be characterized by a single battle or a focused apocalyptic event. If we continue with our current lifestyle, we will experience a slow protracted diminution of quality of life. In how many capitals cities of the world today do we see traffic police wearing masks to protect them from pollution? How many millions of new cases of respiratory disease are due to an atmosphere increasingly degraded by automobile exhausts and industrial emissions?
It is clear that the continued utilization of fossil fuels as a dominant energy source is not consistent with the long-term sustainability of our environment. Other practical forms of commercial industrial energy must be developed and in particular, sources that are renewable and pose the minimum risk to our environment. It was for the purpose of encouraging this concept and widely disseminating some of the more recent development sin this field that FAO requested Professor Miyamoto of Osaka University to compile the following Bulletin on Renewable Biological Systems for Alternative Sustainable Energy Production. Together with his colleagues. Professor Miyamoto has put together a most interesting text which I am certain readers will enjoy. It covers the basic concepts and limitations of renewable biological energy systems and goes on to provide an inspiring vision of their future potential. It is hoped that this Bulletin will stimulate scientists and researchers around the
world to focus additional effort in this very important field. As with all Bulletins of this type, we seek the comments of readers in order to improve future editions of this work.

Summary
The energy crisis experienced in the 1970s was followed by increased concern for the environment with major emphasis on protection of the global ecosystem. The luxurious use of fossil fuels yields significant developmental benefits for industrialized societies, but takes its toll on the environment in the form of large amounts of agricultural, domestic and industrial waste. It is therefore important to pursue material and energy recycling, while minimizing waste, at a global level.
A biomass energy system is a typical example of a recycling system, in which CO[2] is fixed via photosynthesis, and energies accumulated in biological materials are used to release CO[2]. CO[2] fixation by microalgal mass culture is an attractive proposal since through its metabolic machinery, algal biomass is capable of producing H[2]. Algal biomass is also applicable as a substrate for lipid conversion to oil and for cyanobacterial H[2] production. Both bacterial and cyanobacterial H[2] production are currently being investigated with a view to improving productivity through the advanced technology of genetic manipulation. In addition, limited global fossil fuel reserves, make the production of oil from lipids and fatty acids contained in algal biomass an attractive proposition. To this end, thermochemical liquefaction of microalgal biomass is being studied as a means of producing petroleum fuel analogs.
Alcoholic fermentation of cellulosic biomass is of importance because cellulose biomass occurs abundantly in the form of agricultural and forestry wastes. Anaerobic digestion of organic wastes involves a complex series of microbial reactions resulting in the production of methane gas. This process is widely applied in small-scale energy production in rural areas. Modem technologies capable of producing ethanol and methane in larger-scale operations have also been developed.
The potentials and limitations of plant and bacterial photosynthesis and methodologies for improving the quality of biomass energy through microbial conversion processes are discussed in this bulletin. Basic studies on future energy production via microalgal CO[2] fixation, and the future of renewable energy biological systems are also reviewed and discussed.

1.1 Energy and environmental issues
The widespread use of fossil fuels, has brought numerous benefits to industrialized societies. Large amounts of agricultural, domestic and industrial wastes generated in these countries as a result of development, have potentially detrimental effects both on the environment and on human health. Itai-itai and Minamata diseases in Japan, are just two examples of the effects of air and water pollution on human health. The importance of protecting the environment and restoring environmental damage cannot be overemphasized.
In recent years, environmental pollution has become a global problem. Internationalization of industrial and social activities has given rise to problems such as global warming, desertification, and acid deposition. These global problems are rooted in the materially-rich lifestyles which are supported by abundant and wasteful use of fossil fuels in industrialized countries. Rapidly increasing industrial activities in China, India, and in other developing countries implicates that these countries will inevitably contribute to deterioration of the global environment and to destruction of the global ecosystem. Lifestyle changes, and changes in our key industrial systems are required in order to minimize the impact of environmental pollution. The recycling of materials, and thus minimizing the generation of waste, is a basic concept which must be implemented in order to meet the new demands of sustainable development in both industrialized and developing countries.
Mechanisms for implementing this concept and for establishing environmentally compatible technologies which support the future "recycling" world are required. Systems, which utilize energies produced from biomass are typical examples of energy recycling systems. Biotechnology is one of the future-oriented technologies, and one that will play a major role in the exploitation of biomass energy. All biomass (plant, animal and microbial), originates through CO[2] fixation by photosynthesis. Biomass utilization is consequently included in the global carbon cycle of the biosphere. Biomass energy in developing countries, originates from fuelwood, animal wastes, and agricultural residues, and is primarily utilized for activities which are essential to survival, such as cooking and obtaining water. Improvements in the living standards in these countries will result in the non-essential use of energy. Development of technologies that efficiently produce biomass, and convert it to more
convenient forms of energy is therefore very important.
1.2 Photosynthesis and biomass
1.2.1 Photosynthetic efficiency
1.2.2 Biomass wastes and their conversion
1.2.3 Fuel production via microalgal CO2 fixation
1.2.1 Photosynthetic efficiency
Photosynthesis can be simply represented by the equation:
CO[2] + H[2]O + light !' 6 (CH[2]O) + O[2]
Approximately 114 kilocalories of free energy are stored in plant biomass for every mole of CO[2] fixed during photosynthesis. Solar radiation striking the earth on an annual basis is equivalent to 178,000 terawatts, i.e. 15,000 times that of current global energy consumption. Although photosynthetic energy capture is estimated to be ten times that of global annual energy consumption, only a small part of this solar radiation is used for photosynthesis. Approximately two thirds of the net global photosynthetic productivity worldwide is of terrestrial origin, while the remainder is produced mainly by phytoplankton (microalgae) in the oceans which cover approximately 70% of the total surface area of the earth. Since biomass originates from plant and algal photosynthesis, both terrestrial plants and microalgae are appropriate targets for scientific studies relevant to biomass energy production.
Any analysis of biomass energy production must consider the potential efficiency of the processes involved. Although photosynthesis is fundamental to the conversion of solar radiation into stored biomass energy, its theoretically achievable efficiency is limited both by the limited wavelength range applicable to photosynthesis, and the quantum requirements of the photosynthetic process. Only light within the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) can be utilized by plants, effectively allowing only 45 % of total solar energy to be utilized for photosynthesis. Furthermore, fixation of one CO[2] molecule during photosynthesis, necessitates a quantum requirement of ten (or more), which results in a maximum utilization of only 25% of the PAR absorbed by the photosynthetic system. On the basis of these limitations, the theoretical maximum efficiency of solar energy conversion is approximately 11%. In practice, however, the magnitude of
photosynthetic efficiency observed in the field, is further decreased by factors such as poor absorption of sunlight due to its reflection, respiration requirements of photosynthesis and the need for optimal solar radiation levels. The net result being an overall photosynthetic efficiency of between 3 and 6% of total solar radiation.
1.2.2 Biomass wastes and their conversion
Wastes and residues currently constitute a large source of biomass (1). These include solid and liquid municipal wastes, manure, lumber and pulp mill wastes, and forest and agricultural residues. With the exception of feedstocks of low water content, most of this biomass cannot be directly utilized, and must undergo some form of transformation, prior to being utilized as a fuel. Biological processes for the conversion of biomass to fuels include ethanol fermentation by yeast or bacteria, and methane production by microbial consortia under anaerobic conditions.
Wood wastes in the paper and pulp industries and bagasse from the sugar-cane industry are examples of biomass likely to accumulate at a single site. The cellulosic nature of these biomass materials, necessitates their hydrolysis to glucose, prior to ethanol fermentation. The net energy balance for the processes involved can, however, be problematic in that energy requirements for cellulose hydrolysis and distillation, must be lower than the energy in the output ethanol.
Unlike ethanol fermentation, anaerobic digestion for methane production, utilizes organic materials containing carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Many species of microbes work cooperatively in an anaerobic digester, in which these polymeric materials (i.e. carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) are first decomposed to organic acids, and then to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, from which methane is synthesized by methanogens. A variety of raw materials which include agricultural wastes, municipal solid wastes, market garbage, and waste water from food and fermentation industries, are applicable as substrates for this process. Waste products derived from animal husbandry are applicable to anaerobic digestion, with the added bonus of solving the environmental issues of unpleasant odors and eutrophication. Although small-scale digesters are popularly used at both the farm and village levels, large-scale operations are still in need of considerable technical improvement and cost
reduction, and thus require both microbial and engineering studies.
Methane and ethanol can also be produced from cultured microalgal biomass through anaerobic digestion and microbial fermentation processes, respectively. The economics of fuel production from microalgal biomass is however largely dependent on a microalgal CO[2] fixation step similar to that required for the production of H[2] and algal oils.
1.2.3 Fuel production via microalgal CO2 fixation
One of the most serious environmental problems today is that of global warming, caused primarily by the heavy use of fossil fuels. In Japan, large amounts of CO[2] are released into the atmosphere from electric power plants and industry. The CO[2] generated by these large point sources could potentially be recovered with relative ease through the use of an established technology such as chemical absorption. The enormity of the amounts of potentially recoverable CO[2] would however necessitate the development of technologies for sequestering or, more favorably, utilizing this CO[2].
Photosynthetic microalgae are potential candidates for utilizing excessive amounts of CO[2], since when cultivated these organisms are capable of fixing CO[2] to produce energy and chemical compounds upon exposure to sunlight. The derivation of energy from algal biomass is an attractive concept in that unlike fossil fuels, algal biomass is rather uniformly distributed over much of the earth's surface, and its utilization would make no net contribution to increasing atmospheric CO[2] levels. Although algal biomass is regarded as a low-grade energy source owing to its high moisture content, through biological processes, it may be converted to modem gaseous and liquid fuels such as hydrogen, methane, ethanol, and oils.
Hydrogen is regarded as a potential energy source of the future, since it is easily converted to electricity and bums cleanly. Hydrogen is currently produced by fossil fuel-based processes which emit large amounts of CO[2], and relatively smaller amounts of other air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Biological H[2] production has thus recently received renewed attention owing to urban air pollution and global warming concerns (2). Biological hydrogen production methodologies incorporating artificial reconstitution systems with chloroplast, ferredoxin, and hydrogenase; a heterocystous cyanobacterial system with oxygen scavengers; and an algal system in a day-and-night cycle, have been studied in
Japan. From an engineering point of view, however, bacterial fermentation mechanisms for hydrogen production under either dark or light conditions is currently of importance in terms of environmental issues and the utilization of organic wastes such as waste effluent of the food and fermentation industries, pre-treated sewage sludge, and market garbage.
The use of microalgae as sources of liquid fuels is an attractive proposition from the point of view that microalgae are photosynthetic renewable resources, are of a high lipid content, have faster growth rates than plant cells, and are capable of growth in saline waters which are unsuitable for agriculture. While the lipid content of microalgae, on a dry cellular weight basis varies between 20 and 40 %, lipid contents as high as 85 % have been reported for certain microalgal strains. Botryococcus braunii, is a unique microalgal strain, having a long-chain hydrocarbon content of between 30 and 40% (dry weight basis), which is directly extractable to yield crude oil substitutes. Both physical and chemical processes are applicable in the production of liquid fuels from algal strains of high lipid content. These processes include direct lipid extraction in the production of diesel-oil substitutes, transesterification in the formation of ester fuels, and hydrogenation in the
production of hydrocarbons (3). Oily substances are also produced via liquefaction of microalgal biomass through thermochemical reactions under conditions of high pressure and temperature.
1.3 General problems
Among the biomass conversion processes discussed thus far, methane and ethanol production from various wastes is economically feasible within the restraints of scale and location. Although biological processes for the production of gaseous and liquid fuels have been well demonstrated with cultured microalgal biomass, these processes must still be integrated into a system capable of meeting basic requirements for overall efficiency of converting solar energy into biofuels. Furthermore, a model system must at least in principle, be capable of easy scale-up and not be limited by either engineering or economic factors. Under the current petroleum economy, prospects for the use of H[2] or oils produced by biological processes seem remote. However, future requirements for a "clean environment" necessitate fundamental research into microbial and algal physiology and genetics, together with basic engineering research on converters and total systems.
In its effort to address global warming and other environmental problems, the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE), engaged in investigating projects, including the Project for Biological CO[2] Fixation and Utilization, and the Project for Biological Production of Hydrogen Through The Use of Environmentally Acceptable Technologies was established by the Japanese Government in 1990. These projects employ researchers from both national institutes and private companies who are engaged in the research and development of technologies for microbiological CO[2] fixation and the production of hydrogen. At the same time, research efforts at the university level include biochemical and genetic studies on CO[2]-fixing and H[2]-producing enzymes, and the application of these enzymes to the development of more efficient energy systems.
The following Chapters, address biological and engineering aspects of alternative sustainable energy production, with emphasis on recent progress in four specific areas: (i) fuel alcohol production from cellulosic biomass, (ii) improved methane fermentation from industrial and agricultural residues, (iii) biological H[2] production from water and various wastes, and (iv) oil production through thermochemical liquefaction of microalgal biomass. The final Chapter outlines prospects for the future of renewable energy systems, although this is by no means a simple task, since problems concerned with energy, the environment, population, and food, are all interrelated.

References
Adverse environmental effects of the use of fossil fuels have been thoroughly discussed in Chapter 1. Energy demands are nevertheless expected to continue increasing with global improvements in living standards. There is however a limit to the amount of energy consumption that can be tolerated by nature. Excessively large amounts of energy produced by nuclear fusion for example, have the potential of altering terrestrial climates. Renewable sources of energy which do not alter global energy levels are therefore desirable.
2.1 Photosynthetic capture of solar energy
2.1.1 Solar energy
2.1.2 Why is biotechnology now applied to energy technology?
2.1.1 Solar energy
Approximately 5.7 x 10^24 J of solar energy are irradiated to the earth's surface on an annual basis. Plants and photosynthetic organisms utilize this solar energy in fixing large amounts of CO[2] (2x10^11 t = 3x10^21 J/year), while amounts consumed by human beings are relatively small, (3 x 10^20 J/year) (1), representing only 10% of the energy converted during photosynthesis.
Although large amounts of solar energy are irradiated to the earth's surface, the effective energy concentration (energy/unit area) of solar energy at any one point on the earth's surface is small - only about 1 kW/m^2 at most, even at noon. Such low effective energy concentrations, limit the use of solar energy as a primary energy source, and elevate the costs associated with its accumulation and transmission.
Technologies for the utilization of low-density energy sources must be developed in order to facilitate the use of solar energy. Solar energy conversions through the use of photosynthetic microorganisms do not incorporate the use of complex systems or large quantities of factory manufactured products, and indeed have relatively minimal investment and resource requirements. Additionally, these technologies are largely dependent on the use of renewable resources, thereby generating minimal amounts of waste. Recent advances in biotechnology have made possible studies on the utilization of biological processes such as photosynthesis for energy production.
2.1.2 Why is biotechnology now applied to energy technology?
The use of natural energy involves the control of entropy. Prior to the industrial revolution, wood served as a major energy source. However, the industrial revolution gave rise to the widespread use of both coal and petroleum as energy sources. Since coal and petroleum were often produced at sites far from their consumption points, recuperation of their production costs involved mass production, thus precipitating the formation of an integrated industrial society. This integrated system soon reached its limits, making it necessary to consider discrete social systems that utilize delocalized abundant energy sources.
Integration is necessary in any system where energy, goods, and information are dispersed. Integration of systems involves the use of entropy-reducing processes. Application of mechanical methods to the integration of systems incorporates large amounts of energy expenditure. Existing problems cannot therefore be resolved without modification of existing social systems. Consequently, energy production technology must be reformed. Microorganisms have the ability to reduce entropy through energy utilization, and can potentially simplify the conversion and accumulation of solar energy and energy utilization over large areas.
Following the industrial revolution, energy-releasing techniques were developed. The development of techniques which control entropy are essential for human survival. To this end, there is a need for the development of industrial technology which makes use of biological principles in a sophisticated manner.
2.2 Photosynthesis mechanisms
2.2.1 Plant photosynthesis
2.2.2 Bacterial photosynthesis
Biological energy conversions can be categorized into two groups: i) photosynthesis (the process whereby solar energy is fixed to yield energy useful to organisms and industry), and ii) biomass conversion (the product of photosynthesis) into energy. Photosynthesis occurs in plants, algae and photosynthetic bacteria, while biomass conversion reactions often occur in non-photosynthetic microorganisms. This Chapter focuses on photosynthetic processes.
2.2.1 Plant photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is often regarded as a CO[2] anabolic reaction, whereby glucose is formed from CO[2] and water. CO[2] anabolism is an energy-consuming reaction in that it utilizes chemical energy produced by photosynthesis. In its narrowest sense, photosynthesis can be regarded as a process whereby energy is supplied for CO[2] anabolism. In a broader sense, photosynthesis, including CO[2] anabolism, can be divided into several steps: i) photoelectric charge isolation using photon energy (conversion to electrical energy), ii) fixation of electrical energy in the form of chemical energy (ATP synthesis), and iii) chemical reactions involving ATP (fixation of CO[2], and hydrogen production).
The supply of energy for CO[2] anabolism is common to all photosynthetic organisms which exhibit photosynthesis. Energy conversion, ATP synthesis and the production of both CO[2] and hydrogen on the other hand, are not unique to photosynthetic organisms, but occur in all types of microorganisms, and are in fact similar to the respiratory processes which occur in mitochondria of higher organisms.
Two types of photosynthesis are distinguishable on the basis of source of the electrons used as energy carriers. In plants such as green algae, and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), water is the electron source, while in photosynthetic bacteria, organic or sulfur compounds provide electron sources.
Photosynthetic mechanisms which occur within plant photosynthetic membranes are schematically presented in Figure 2-1. Two Photosystem II water molecules are initially decomposed by four incident photons, to yield one oxygen molecule and four excited electrons. Excited electron energy is subsequently utilized in ATP synthesis. Unlike in the case of ordinary chemical reactions, ATP synthesis cannot be stoichiometrically analyzed (2). The ratio of excited photons to ATP produced is still a somewhat debatable issue. Although it has generally been thought that two photons give rise to the formation of two ATP molecules, some researchers claim that three photons are involved (3). Furthermore, other researchers have suggested a loose coupling between proton transport and ATP synthesis (4, 5):
4 photons + 2H[2]O + 2(or more)ADP = 2(or more)ATP + 4H^+ + 4e^-+O[2]
Subsequent to their energy release in ATP production, photosystem II electrons are transported to photosystem I, where they are again excited to a higher energy level, allowing them to be utilized for NADP reduction. NADP serves both as an electron carrier and an oxidizing and reducing agent in vivo. Two photons are utilized per molecule of NADP reduced:
4 photons + 4e^- + 2NADP + 4H^+ = 2NADPH.
Photosystem I may also be involved in ATP synthesis. In cases where it is involved, excited photosystem I electrons are recycled:
4 photons + 2(or more)ADP = 2(or more)ATP.
Fixation of one molecule of CO[2], involves the following reaction:
CO[2] + 3ATP + 2NADPH = CH[2]O + 3ADP + 2NADP.
If two ATP molecules are obtained through Photosystem II excitation (Eq. 2-1), the net reaction, following equations 2-1 through 2-4 is:
CO[2] + 10 photons + H[2]O = CH[2]O + 1/2O[2].
Figure 2.1 - Schematic representation of mechanisms involved in plant photosynthesis
Experimental data indicates that between 8 and 12 photons are required for fixation of one molecule of CO[2]. Since the energy equivalent of one photon (700 nm) is approximately 170 kJ/E, and the change in free energy during the fixation of CO[2] is approximately 450 U/mol, the energy efficiency of this process for monochromatic light of a wavelength of 700 nm is estimated to be approximately 21-33%. However, owing to the quantum nature of photosynthetic reactions, energy efficiency decreases if light of shorter wavelengths (i.e. higher quantum energy) is used. Additionally, energy losses, energy requirements for plant growth, and the distribution of solar energy wavelengths need to be considered.
Plant photosynthesis takes place only in the presence of visible light (400-700 nm). However, solar light contains both visible and infrared components. Since visible light accounts for about 45% of all solar energy, the maximum achievable energy efficiency for CO[2] fixation using solar radiation is approximately 13%.
2.2.2 Bacterial photosynthesis
Bacterial photosynthesis is thought to be a relatively old form of photosynthesis. It incorporates the use of either organic or sulfur compounds as electron donors in photosystem I (Figure 2-2). Unlike in the case of plant photosynthesis, cyclic photophosphorylation takes place in bacterial photosynthesis, i.e. electrons are repeatedly excited in a cyclic manner, with ATP being generated in each cycle. Photosynthetic bacteria are also capable of reducing electron carriers such as NAD, via a linear reaction similar to the electron transmission which occurs during plant photosynthesis (Figure 2-2).
Figure 2.2 - Schematic representation of mechanisms involved in bacterial photosynthesis
CO[2]-fixing reactions do not produce energy during bacterial photosynthesis (i.e equimolar amounts of organic compounds are produced through decomposition of organic compounds), except when sulfur compounds serve as electron carriers. The energy conversion efficiency for this type of photosynthesis is more fully described in Chapter 5.
2 photons + 1 (or more)ADP = 1 (or more)ATP.
Electrons are donated as follows:
CH[2]O + H[2]O = 4e^- + 4H^+ + CO[2].
The structure of the photosynthetic reaction center (RC), involved in the early steps of photosynthesis, has been elucidated for certain photosynthetic bacteria (Fig. 2-3). Such chlorophyll- containing bacteria which include Rhodopseudomonas viridis and Rhodobacter sphaeroides, show similarities with respect to the arrangement of chlorophyll, and the three-dimensional structures of major portions of the proteins possessing that pigment. Such structural similarities between photosynthetic bacteria, seem to suggest the acquisition of an optimal structure by these bacteria, over a long evolutionary period.
Pigments such as bacteriochlorophyll are also present within the RC. Photoelectric charge isolation takes place within dimers of these bacteriochlorphyll pigments, resulting in the release of high-energy electrons, via the action of bacteriochlorophyll monomers such as bacteriopheophytin, quinone A, and quinone B. These high-energy electrons are subsequently conjugated with proton transportation in the cytochrome b/c1 complex.
Figure 2.3 - Initial steps of photosynthesis in bacterial photosynthetic membranes
A noteworthy feature of the RC function is that photon involvement in photoelectric charge isolation, resembles that which occurs in photo-semiconductors. These RC centres can thus be regarded as molecular elements produced by nature. The fact that photoelectric charge isolation is observed in protein molecules will greatly influence future research relevant to molecular elements and solar batteries.
2.3 Hydrogen production through solar energy conversions
2.3.1 Cyanobacterial hydrogen production (plant-type photosynthesis)
2.3.2 Bacterial hydrogen production (bacterial-type photosynthesis)
2.3.3 Use of photosynthesized proteins in photoelectric conversion elements
Although large amounts of solar energy are irradiated to the earth's surface, the actual concentration (energy/unit area) of solar energy at the earth's surface is relatively low. The accumulation of solar energy for practical use, therefore necessitates collection of solar energy over large areas. This could potentially be a costly venture, particularly with respect to the use of solar batteries for solar energy concentration. Photosynthetic bacteria however have the potential to eliminate requirements for such large batteries for solar collection.
Hydrogen appears to be the most useful form of solar-converted energy, in that it can be easily substituted for petroleum-based fuels. The use of hydrogen is also advantageous in that when burnt it yields only water, and hence does not contribute to environmental pollution.
2.3.1 Cyanobacterial hydrogen production (plant-type photosynthesis)
Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and photosynthetic bacteria are representative photosynthetic hydrogen producers. In vivo hydrogen production by these microorganisms is catalyzed by either nitrogenase or hydrogenase enzymes. Nitrogenases require ATP for catalytic action:
2H^+ + 2e^-*(Fd) + 4ATP = H[2] + 4ADP.
Hydrogenases which catalyze hydrogen production in organisms such as Clostridium, on the other hand, do not require ATP for their activity. However, since hydrogenase activity involves some hydrogen uptake, the efficiency of hydrogen production through hydrogenase activity is low. Relatively little hydrogen is produced by these organisms in the absence of strong electron donors such as ferredoxin (Fd):
2H^+ + e^-* = H[2]
(e^-*: high-energy electrons in NADH, Fd[red], etc.).
Where hydrogenase enzymes are used for hydrogen production and the reducing potential, yielded by photosynthetic reactions is completely used for reducing hydrogen ions, two photons can theoretically produce one hydrogen molecule:
2 photons + H[2]O + 1(or more)ADP = 1(or more)ATP + 2H^+ + 2e^- + 1/2O[2]
2 photons + 2e^- = 2e^-*
2H^+ + 2e^-* = H[2] (by hydrogenase).
Hydrogenase-mediated reactions in cyanobacteria are not usually biased in favour of hydrogen production. Instead, such reactions are likely to cause hydrogen uptake and are consequently impractical. It is highly likely that the high-energy electrons, yielded as a result of Clostridium) or by the use of these organic substances as electron donors. The efficiency of the latter reaction can be determined by multiplying the efficiency of CO[2]; anabolism by the efficiency of hydrogen production in photosynthetic bacteria.
Although there are few reports of precisely determined hydrogen production efficiencies of cyanobacteria, Miyamoto et al. determined that outdoor solar incubation for a period exceeding one month in California, resulted in an average energy conversion efficiency (energy yielded by combustion of produced hydrogen/incidence solar energy) of 0.2% (6).
2.3.2 Bacterial hydrogen production (bacterial-type photosynthesis)
Bacterial mechanisms for photosynthetic hydrogen production are summarized in Figure 2-4. Upon exposure of ammonia-free media containing photosynthetic bacteria to light, nitrogenase activity is induced, resulting in hydrogen production. Organic substances such as lactic acid (Eq. 2-13) serve as electron donors in photosynthetic bacteria. In such reactions, "G is positive, indicating that the use of solar energy allows photosynthetic bacteria to produce hydrogen through complete decomposition of organic substances. Anaerobes such as Clostridium also produce hydrogen, but are incapable of completely utilizing energy or decomposing organic substances (Eq. 2-14):
C[3]H[6]O[3] + 3H[2]O = 12H^+ + 3CO[2] + 12e^- = 6H[2] + 3CO[2]
"G = 51.2 kJ
C[6]H[12]O[6] + 2H[2]O = 4H[2] + 2CH[3]COOH + 2CO[2]

Photosynthetic bacteria are capable of completely decomposing organic substances. Studies on hydrogen production through the exposure of organic wastes (waste fluids from food factories, pulp factories, etc.) to photosynthetic bacteria and light, have been conducted in a number of countries. Research into hydrogen production using a combination of photosynthetic bacteria and anaerobes has also been conducted.
A key factor in determining the commercial applicability of hydrogen production processes, is the rate at which hydrogen is produced. Bacteria have been widely investigated for their rates of hydrogen production. To date, R. sphaeroides has been identified as the bacterium having the highest hydrogen-producing rate (260 ml/mg/h) (7), with a photoenergy conversion efficiency (energy yielded by combustion of produced hydrogen/incident solar energy) of 7%, determined using a solar simulator (7, 8). Further strain development will potentially elevate the energy conversion efficiency of photosynthetic bacteria to levels comparable to those of solar batteries.
Figure 2.4 - Mechanism for hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria
Organic substances are utilized as electron donors by photosynthetic bacteria. The energy required for extracting electrons from these molecules is much lower than that required for the hydrolysis of water. Photo-energy is more often used for nitrogenase activation, i.e. ATP reproduction (Eq. 2-10), than for the decomposition of organic substances. The number of photons required for ATP reproduction by photosynthetic bacteria has not been theoretically elucidated, though an experimental number of 1.5 has been determined (9). A value of 1 has also been suggested (10).
In addition to ATP, nitrogenase-mediated reactions, require Fd as an electron carrier. Reaction mechanisms involved have not however been completely elucidated (10, 11). The reducing potential, created in the RC of purple, non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria such as R. sphaeroides and R. capsulatus is approximately 100 mV at most (12). Such bacteria would be incapable of directly reducing Fd, which has an oxidizing and reducing potential of approximately 400 mV. ATP may however be capable of reducing Fd. Assuming that one ATP molecule is used for reducing one Fd molecule, at least six ATP molecules are needed for the production of one hydrogen molecule, resulting in a net requirement for nine photons. Since an 850-nm photon has an energy content of 141 kJ energy, the photon energy required for the production of hydrogen is 1269 kJ/mol H[2] if monochromatic light of 850 nm is used. Energy is also required for the decomposition of organic substances (Equation 2-13). This energy
is however, much lower (8.5 kJ/mol H[2] in the case of lactic acid) than the energy required for nitrogenase-mediated reactions.
It is unlikely that improvements can be made in the photo-energy conversion efficiencies of nitrogenases. On the other hand, hydrogenases catalyze hydrogen-producing reactions without ATP requirements (Eq. 2-9). Hydrogenase-catalyzed reactions are reversible, and are either biased in favour of hydrogen production or hydrogen uptake. Hydrogenases in Clostridium and other bacteria work primarily to produce hydrogen, while hydrogenases in photosynthetic bacteria work toward hydrogen uptake. Hydrogen-producing efficiency is known to be higher in hydrogenase-deplete strains of photosynthetic bacteria.
Hydrogen-producing hydrogenases, such as those which occur in species such as Clostridium are required for hydrogen production. However, problems such as the necessity for complex control are encountered with the use of hydrogenases. Technologies for the incorporation of hydrogenases into reaction systems must therefore be developed.
2.3.3 Use of photosynthesized proteins in photoelectric conversion elements
As stated above, RC is capable of converting photo-energy into electrical energy. It can therefore be utilized in either photoelectric converters or photo-semiconductors. Solar batteries containing chromatophore membranes or an RC are now available. The RC is a relatively stable protein which retains its photoelectric conversion function even in the dry state (13). Unlike ordinary enzymes, the RC neither binds to the substrate nor undergoes chemical reactions, except for its binding to, or dissociation from quinones. Upon exposure to photons within membranes, the RC only releases electrons and has no mobile portions. Unlike enzymes, the RC does not need to vibrate within water molecules. Using the Langmuir-Blodgett method, it is possible to prepare dried RC photoelectric devices (14).

3.1 Introduction
Following the successive oil crises of the 1970's, renewable alternatives to petroleum as an energy source, have been intensively investigated worldwide. The Research Association for Petroleum Alternatives Development (RAPAD) was established in Japan, in May 1980, by 23 private companies with the support of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). One of RAPAD's main tasks was to investigate the development of technologies for biomass conversion and utilization, in particular, the production of ethanol from cellulosic biomass. As a part of this project, studies were conducted in our laboratory, on the production of fuel ethanol from cellulosic biomass.
Various forms of biomass resources exist (Fig. 3-1). Among these, sugar and starch crops are inappropriate for use as energy sources since they are primary food sources, and are unstable from the viewpoints of long-term supply and cost. Cellulosic resources, on the other hand, represent the most abundant global source of biomass, and have been largely unutilized. In our study on fuel ethanol production processes, our efforts were directed toward the use of agricultural waste materials such as bagasse or sugar cane molasses, rice straw, and forestry waste materials such as wood chips from thinning.
Cellulose, a main component of plant cell walls, can be solubilized by either enzymatic or acid hydrolysis. Enzymatic processes are however preferable owing to drawbacks of the acid hydrolysis process. The development of cellulose-decomposing enzymes, i.e. high-titer cellulases, is however a problem that needs to be addressed prior to implementation of the enzymatic hydrolytic process. The commercial feasibility of ethanol production from cellulosic biomass is dependent on the availability of a cheap source of cellulase. Extensive work conducted in our laboratory resulted in the development a high titer cellulase from Trichoderma reesei which can be produced at a low cost.
In order to enhance the efficiency of the use of cellulase enzymes, immobilized yeast cells were used as the enzyme source. This resulted in the development of a continuous process for the production of ethanol from cellulosic biomass (rice, straw, bagasse, and wood) and led to the construction of a pilot plant. While this plant includes unit processes which have been studied by various research organizations (1, 2, 3), it was the first such total system to be constructed worldwide.

3.2.1 Cellulase
Successful utilization of cellulosic materials as renewable carbon sources is dependent on the development of economically feasible process technologies for cellulase production, and for the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic materials to low molecular weight products such as hexoses and pentoses. Spano et al. (4) showed that cellulase production, was the most expensive step during ethanol production from cellulosic biomass, in that it accounted for approximately 40% of the total cost. Significant cost reduction is required in order to enhance the commercial viability of cellulase production technology.
A cellulosic enzyme system consists of three major components: endo-ß-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.4), exo-ß-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.91) and ß-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21). The mode of action of each of these being:
(1) Endo-p-glucanase, 1,4-ß-D-glucan glucanohydrolase, CMCase, Cx: "random" scission of cellulose chains yielding glucose and cello-oligo saccharides.
(2) Exo-P-glucanase, 1,4-ß - D-glucan cellobiohydrolase, Avicelase, C1: exo-attack on the non-reducing end of cellulase with cellobiose as the primary structure.
(3) ß-glucosidase, cellobiase: hydrolysis of cellobiose to glucose.
Reese et al. 1950 (5) proposed that exo-ß-glucanase causes a disruption in cellulose hydrogen bonding, followed by hydrolysis of the accessible cellulose with endo-ß-gucanase. Although cellulase isolation techniques have not been fully developed, the hypothesis depicted in Fig. 3-2 is now accepted. According to this hypothesis, in a synergistic sequence of events, endo-ß-glucanase acts randomly on the cellulose chain, while exo-ß-glucanase acts on exposed chain ends by splitting off cellobiose or glucose. Cellobiose is subsequently hydrolysed by p-glucosidase to glucose. This hypothesis is however the opposite of that proposed by Reese et al. (5), and indicates that three, rather that two enzymes are essential for the decomposition of cellulosic biomass.
3.2.2 Screening of cellulase-producing microorganisms
Although a large number of microorganisms are capable of degrading cellulose, only a few of these microorganisms produce significant quantities of cell-free enzymes capable of completely hydrolysing crystalline cellulose in vitro. Fungi are the main cellulase-producing microorganisms, though a few bacteria and actinomycetes have also been recently reported to yield cellulase activity (Table 3-1). Microorganisms of the genera Trichoderma and Aspergillus are thought to be cellulase producers, and crude enzymes produced by these microorganisms are commercially available for agricultural use. Microorganisms of the genus Trichoderma produce relatively large quantities of endo-ß-glucanase and exo-ß-glucanase, but only low levels of ß-glucosidase, while those of the genus Aspergillus produce relatively large quantities of endo-ß-glucanase and ß-glucosidase with low levels of exo-ß- glucanase production.
In order to obtain a high titer cellulase-producing strain, various cellulase-producing strains obtained from Japanese and overseas research institutions were screened in our laboratory. On the basis of this screening, Trichoderma reesei QM-9414, isolated by the U.S. Army Natick Laboratory, was selected as the best cellulase-producing strain and was subjected to mono-colony isolation in order to obtain strain KY-746, which was used as a parent strain. A plate screening system which enables the isolation and evaluation of mutants was initially investigated, which led to the development of methodology for producing high titer cellulase (Section 3.2.3.1). Fungal strains of the genus Trichoderma, when cultured on an agar medium, are generally difficult to isolate, owing to the lateral spreading of hyphae over the surface. Hyphal growth was controlled by the addition of Triton X-100^7 and L-sorbose, an inhibitor of P-l,3-glucan biosynthesis, to the medium (Fig. 3-3), thus
enabling a large number of strains to be screened. The genealogy of the representative strains created in our laboratory is presented in Fig. 3-4. Large numbers of mutant strains exhibiting a diversity of characteristics were obtained by UV and nitrosoguanidine (NTG) treatment and various other techniques. A strain free from catabolite repression for example, was induced using a culture medium containing glycerol and glucose, while a high titer strain was induced by addition of L-sorbose to the medium. In addition, a strain of elevated (3-glucosidase activity was isolated from medium containing 4-methyl-umbelliferyl-ß-D-glucoside.

3.2.3.2 Cellulase production at low cost
3.2.3.3 Potential for mass production of cellulase
The commercial use of cellulases is dependent on the following:
i) high titer and good enzymatic activity
ii) low production cost, and
iii) feasible mass production.
3.2.3.1 Development of a process for high-titer cellulase production
Representative mutants derived from KY-746 were batch cultured in a 5-L fermentor. Considerable enhancement of titer was observed in four strains: KDG-3, PC-3-7, PCD-10, and CDU-11 (Table 3-2). An evaluation of carbon source utilization by these microorganisms, suggested that the production of high-titer cellulases necessitated an increase in the concentration of Avicel, the carbon source. A somewhat lower than expected maximum cellulase titer was however obtained at Avicel concentrations greater than 6% in batch culture (Fig. 3-5). This relatively lower titer, may be attributed either to adsorption of the cellulase produced on to the Avicel, or rate limitation of aeration due to the high viscosity of the culture medium. In order to overcome this, semi-batch culturing was investigated, where it was found that an initial Avicel concentration of 6%, followed by subsequent addition of 4% Avicel together with other components after a few days, resulted in relatively higher titer
cellulase than that obtained in the batch process (Table 3-3). Titer improvement by the semi-batch process was however dependent on the types of microorganisms used. While the titer of KY-746 was relatively unaffected by the semi-batch process, various degrees of improvement in titer were observed for KDG-3, PC-3-7, PCD-10, and CDU-11. This semi-batch process was further utilized in order to optimize the stirring rate, aeration volume, feed change, seed volume, and the seed culture period. T. reesei generally exhibits poor (3-glucosidase activity. Strain CDU-11 was therefore created in order to enhance p-glucosidase activity. P-glucosidase activity can also be induced by elaborately controlling culture conditions.
Figure 3.3 - Clearing zones formed by T. reesei mutants on Walseth's Cellulose Agar Plates
CMCase, Avicelase, and FPU activities exhibited a pH optimum of approximately 4, while the pH optimum of P-glucosidase was between pH 5 and 6. pH adjustment was therefore investigated with the objective of uniformly inducing all three activities. Culturing at pH 4 for 2 days, followed by a shift to either pH 5 or 6 on the third day, resulted in a marked increase in the p-glucosidase activity of PC-3-7, but no beneficial effect was observed in the case of CDU-11 and of KDG-3, which was already of high [3-glucosidase activity (Table 3-4). On the basis of these findings, a scale-up experiment was conducted in a 1-kL tank using the semi-batch culturing method with 10% Avicel as a carbon source and soybean curd as a nitrogen source. The pH was controlled and shifted as described above. Results are shown in Fig. 3-6. With a shortened culture period of 12 days, elevated activities of 530 U/ml and 8 U/ml were obtained for CMCase and p-glucosidase respectively, with an elevated
protein content of 40 mg/ml in the culture broth. The soluble protein content of the culture broth was 53 mg/ml, which was considered favorable.

3.2.3.2 Cellulase production at low cost
Cellulase is an inducible enzyme. Sophorose, a decomposition product of crystalline cellulose, is thought to be an indispensable inducer of cellulase activity. Although cellulase culture has been investigated with the use of Avicel and other crystalline celluloses as carbon sources, cheaper carbon and nitrogen sources are desired in order to lower production costs.
Figure 3.5 - Effect of initial substrate concentration on cellulase production by batch fermentation
An evaluation of the use of cheese whey, bagasse, and rice straw, as potential substrates for cellulase production, confirmed that PC-3-7 was capable of fermenting these substrates and efficiently producing cellulase enzymes. PC-3-7 was created as a strain, capable of partially producing cellulase enzymes. Table 3-5 shows an example of cellulase production using cheese whey as the carbon source. Flask-scale production of cellulase using bagasse and rice straw, the main raw materials used for fuel alcohol production, is shown in Fig. 3-7. Alkali pre-treatment of biomass was observed to enhance cellulase production. This seems to suggest that cellulase production is directly proportional to the crystallinity of the biomass from which it is produced, i.e. the higher the crystallinity, the better the yield of cellulase.
The use of soybean curd, a low-cost nitrogen source, which is applicable as a substitute for expensive yeast extract and polypeptone, was investigated with cellulase fermentation residues (mainly waste cells). Results obtained, revealed that addition of 5% of the fermentation residue induced cellulase activity similar to that induced by the use of either yeast extract or polypeptone.

Cellulase fermentation was conducted with high-titer enzyme-producing strain CDU-11 under semi-batch conditions in a 4-L fermentor, using inexpensive carbon and nitrogen sources and the pH-shift system. This resulted in the production of CMCase activity exceeding 600 U/ml and (3-glucosidase activity exceeding 30 U/ml. Such activity levels could feasibly be practically applied to the development of scaled-up processes.

3.3.1 Pre-treatment of cellulosic waste
Lignocellulosic biomass contains cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and ash combined in a complex structure (Table 3-6). Pre-treatment increases the crystallinity of cellulose, while removing lignin and other inhibitors, thereby enabling its enzymatic degradation. In addition, pretreatment may increase the surface area of the cellulose thereby enhancing its reactivity with the enzyme and thus its transformation.

Bagasse and rice straw were pre-treated with alkali in our studies as shown in Fig. 3-8. This raw material was crudely crushed (to less than 9 mm in diameter), and qualitatively fed into a counter-current extractor in which delignification was effected through counter-current contact of the raw material with sodium hydroxide, followed by washing with warm water. High alkali concentrations in the reaction mixture however caused simultaneous dissolution of pentosan, leading to a reduction in sugar recovery (Fig. 3-9). The optimum biomass to sodium hydroxide ratio for favorable saccharification was determined to be 1.0:0.12. Relationships between alkali concentration, the sugar composition of the enzymatically saccharified solution and the saccharification rate of bagasse are presented in Figs. 3-9 and 3-10. The xylose content of the saccharified solution decreased with increasing alkali concentration, under temperature conditions of 80 to 100°C, over a 1.5 to 2 hour period.
Steam explosion of beech and cedar was conducted, since alkali treatment of these woods after crushing did not result in saccharification.

3.3.2.1 Saccharification
Saccharification of cellulosic waste materials was conducted using mutant strains obtained from Trichoderma reesei QM-9414 by mutation, (Section 3.2.2), as sources of cellulase enzymes (6, 7). A high titer, low cost cellulase was obtained in our laboratory subsequent to extensive studies on optimum culturing of these strains as described in Section 3.2.3.
Changes in the production of typical cellulase enzymes, by Trichoderma reesei KDG-3 over time, are summarized in Fig. 3-11, while the time course of saccharification with bagasse as a substrate is presented in Fig. 3-12. Enzyme requirements for the saccharification process are summarized in Table 3-7.
Saccharification reaction processes were studied using three reactor types: batch, continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), and the tubular plug flow process. The plug flow process produced the most favorable results in that large quantities of free enzyme were recoverable from this process at late stages of the reaction. Utilizing this process, a saccharification rate exceeding 80% was achieved at a high saccharification concentration. The adsorption of large quantities of enzyme by saccharification residues, lowered the rate of sugar production. Sugar recovery was however facilitated by stirring.
The saccharification rate and the load on the subsequent ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane processes as well as energy requirements of the process, need to be carefully considered in the selection of an appropriate saccharification process. On the basis of currently available data, these processes have both benefits and disadvantages.

3.3.2.2 Recovery and re-use of cellulase
Although a fairly efficient cellulase production process providing a high titer cellulase at relatively low cost was developed, cellulase production was still a costly venture. The use of techniques which enable recovery and reuse of cellulase through separation of the sugar solution and cellulase from the saccharification reaction mixture, were therefore investigated using a UF membrane. A basic flow diagram of the UF membrane treatment utilized is presented in Fig. 3-13.
Figure 3.12 - Time course of bagasse saccharification by T. reesei KDG-3
Figure 3.13 - Flow diagram outlining steps involved in UF membrane treatment of saccharified solutions
Saccharified solutions of various concentrations were centrifuged, following which unreacted residue was separated, and the filtrate was subjected to UF membrane filtration. The UF membrane filtrate was subsequently concentrated, and the resulting retentate was concentrated and re-used as recovered enzyme. During this procedure, the pressure of the UF membrane was maintained at approximately 3 kg/cm^2G, while the temperature of the circulating liquid was maintained between 30 and 40°C. The enzyme solution was concentrated to approximately one-tenth of its original volume. Only small amounts of residue were obtained after centrifugation of saccharified solutions of low-concentration, with sugar recovery exceeding 95%. However, when high-concentration saccharified solutions were employed, large amounts of residue resulted, and sugar recovery subsequent to centrifugation and membrane filtration was somewhat lower, i.e., 83 to 89% after centrifugation and 88% subsequent to UF
membrane filtration. The addition of water either to the residue or to the concentrate improved sugar recovery to a level similar to that obtained in the case of low-concentration saccharified solutions. Similar behaviour was observed with respect to enzyme recovery, although the recovery rate for the enzyme was approximately 80%. Recovered enzyme showed normal saccharification activity. UF membranes have now been successfully used for almost four years, without any degradation. These membranes can be safely operated with periodic chemical or ball-washing.
3.3.2.3 Sugar concentration using reverse osmosis
Sugar solutions obtained via saccharification and enzyme recovery using the UF membrane, varied in concentration from 3 to 15%, depending upon the method used in their preparation. When subjected to alcohol fermentation, these sugar solutions produced low alcohol concentrations thus requiring large amounts of energy for alcohol concentration and dehydration. Concentration of sugar solutions to between 25 and 30%, using a RO membrane was studied. A flow diagram of the basic methodology used is shown in Fig. 3-14. RO was conducted by the loose RO method, using a spiral polyamide membrane, at a pressure of 40 to 50 kg/cm G and circulating liquid temperature of 25 to 30°C. In order to prevent contamination of the membrane system, warm-water washing and washing with 0.1% sodium hydroxide were performed every three days. Sugar recovery exceeding 95% was confirmed at a permeation rate of 100 to 300 L/m/d. Permeation of sugar into the filtrate was not detected.
A 25 to 30% sugar concentration was obtained regardless of the sugar concentration of the initial saccharified solution. Table 3-8 shows the results of the RO membrane operation using filtrate derived from UF membrane-treated low-concentration saccharified solutions.

3.4 Use of immobilized yeast cells in alcohol fermentation's
3.4.1 Preparation of immobilized yeast cells
3.4.2 Continuous plant operation using immobilized yeast cells
3.4.3 Fermentation processes used in ethanol production
3.4.4 Flash fermentation using immobilized yeast cells
Alcohol fermentation is a well established technology which has long been practiced throughout the world. Continuous alcohol production with the use of immobilized yeasts, which give rise to more efficient fermentation, is described in this Section. A fermentation process incorporating the flash method which is seen as a means of improving alcohol productivity using yeasts with poor alcohol resistance is also discussed here.
3.4.1 Preparation of immobilized yeast cells
Of the various methods used for continuous fermentation, that employing the use of immobilized yeast cells was selected. Methods of yeast immobilization evaluated included collagen casting, acetic acid-lactic acid cellulose microencapsulation, chitosan/glutar-aldehyde molding, carrageenan-entrapping method, and calcium alginate gel-entrapping. Of these, the calcium alginate gel-entrapping method was preferred because of its high enzymatic activity, simple manner of preparation, and stability.
Preparation of a uniform calcium alginate gel, necessitated maintaining the viscosity of the mixture of calcium alginate and yeast cells between 1000 and 2000 cps. The addition of a nonionic surfactant and an unsaturated fatty acid at the time of gelling was also found to improve cell retention and enzyme activity. Preparation of immobilized yeast cells is outlined in Fig 3-15.
Figure 3.15 - Immobilization of yeast cells
3.4.2 Continuous plant operation using immobilized yeast cells
The spherical gel method was employed for the preparation of calcium alginate gels since this method does not require the use of specialized equipment. Spherical gels are readily obtained by adding sodium alginate solution to calcium chloride solution using a nozzle. No special granulation apparatus was used when the equipment was assembled, but a gel-dropping nozzle was provided at the top of the fermentor. The fermentor was filled with a calcium chloride solution prior to fermentation, and sodium alginate solution was added dropwise to form granules. The culture medium was then supplied to the fermentor to initiate the fermentation. This procedure was found to simplify the gel preparation process.
Continuous fermentation tests were conducted using two 1-kL fermentors arranged in series. The results are shown in Fig. 3-16. Continuous production of alcohol was carried out stably for 4000 hours while maintaining high enzymatic activity (8).
3.4.3 Fermentation processes used in ethanol production
Alcohol productivity has been greatly improved through the development of bioreactors. Alcohol production by the batch method, immobilized continuous, and immobilized flash methods are compared in Table 3-9.
3.4.4 Flash fermentation using immobilized yeast cells
Alcohol inhibition of yeasts, does not pose any problems in alcohol fermentation by the batch method, since yeasts are used only once in batch processes. In such processes, yeast damage due to alcoholic inhibition is of relatively little significance. However, where immobilized continuous methods of alcohol production are used, stable yeast activity needs to be maintained, and the alcohol concentration in the fermentor must be relatively low. The relationship between alcohol concentration and fermentation rate, using an immobilized yeast fermentor is presented in Figure 3-17. Several methods of continuously removing alcohol from fermentors as a means of avoiding alcoholic inhibition of yeasts have been proposed. The fermentor used in our study was equipped with a distillation column (operable either under atmospheric or reduced pressure), as shown in Fig. 3-18. Circulation of the fermentation broth through this distillation column, enabled the removal of alcohol, and sugar
thereby facilitating the maintainance of low alcohol concentrations within the fermentor. Results obtained using a 200-L scale pilot fermentation are shown in Fig. 3-19. Alcoholic inhibition of yeast was reduced while the fermentation rate increased. In addition, this method enabled raw material to be used at a high concentration, reducing the volume of waste liquor. However, the use of raw material at a high concentration necessitates a relatively longer retention time within the fermentor, thus increasing the accumulation of by-products, which inevitably reduces the fermentation rate due to by-product inhibition.

3.5.8 Alcohol recovery
Various aspects of alcohol fermentation from cellulosic biomass have been discussed thus far. A number of problems still remain to be resolved prior to industrial-scale production of fuel alcohol from cellulosic biomass. As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, subsequent to our studies on basic and elemental techniques, an integrated pilot plant for the production of alcohol from biomass, was constructed in our laboratory, in order to demonstrate individual processes. Construction of the plant commenced in 1983, and continued in a step-wise manner for 5 years. The final plant was capable of treating 720 kg of raw material per day with the production of 150 to 200 liters of dehydrated fuel alcohol. A process flow diagram of the pilot plant is given in Fig. 3-20, while Fig. 3-21 shows a plan of the plant.

3.5.1 Outline
Bagasse, rice straw, and beech wood chips, the compositions of which are shown in Table 3-6, were used as cellulosic biomass in the pilot plant. These materials vary in composition, and are thus presumed to differ in three-dimensional structure. Cellulose can either be saccharified by an acid process, or by an enzymatic process using cellulase. For the pilot plant, the enzymatic process was adopted in view of problems associated with the acid process, i.e., the necessity for the use of acid-resistant equipment, technical difficulties relating to the recovery of acid, and the formation of by-products due to excessive decomposition. At the outset, cellulase of a high titer and balanced enzymatic activity was unavailable, which meant that a long period of time was required for saccharification. However, by employing a variety of screening and mutational techniques, a high titer cellulase that could be produced at a low cost was developed. Saccharification from both low- and
high-concentration biomass was investigated, and an appraisal of the most suitable types of reactor was made. Owing to the high cost of cellulase, its recovery and re-use were investigated using UF techniques. With the objective of improving the efficiency of alcohol fermentation and thus saving energy, the use of RO as a means of concentrating the sugar solutions was investigated. Alcohol fermentation was conducted by the immobilized flash method using a bioreactor in combination with the flash method for the purpose of accelerating alcohol production while minimizing the influence of alcohol generated on yeast cells. Two methods were used to evaluate the recovery of alcohol: the conventional azeotropic distillation method, and a combination of the super critical fluid extraction (SCFE) and pervaporation methods. In addition, the plant was evaluated as a total system using waste water, which mainly consisted of lignin waste water derived from the pre-treatment step and
alcohol fermentation waste water. This waste water was treated by the methane fermentation method using a cell concentration apparatus fitted with a membrane. Low-concentration alcohol leaking from the SCFE-pervaporation, and immobilized flash fermentation steps was recovered using RO. The processing steps employed in the plant are described individually in the following Sections.

Figure 3.20 - Flow diagram outlining processes in an integrated bench plant
Figure 3.21 - Schematic of the layout of an integrated bench plant
3.5.2 Pre-treatment of cellulosic biomass
Pre-treatment of cellulosic biomass was conducted as described in Section 3.3.1. Bagasse and rice straw were crudely crushed and pre-treated with alkali at 90 to 120°C for 1 to 2 hours in a double screw-type counter-current extractor. The optimum ratio by weight of sodium hydroxide to biomass was 0.08 to 0.1. In the case of beech wood chips, since saccharification did not proceed with sodium hydroxide treatment, steam explosion was found to be effective. Steam explosion combined with treatment by alkali and salts produced good results.
3.5.3 Cellulase production
Bacteria represented by the genus Cellulomonas, and yeast strains including those of the genus Trichosporon were used for cellulase production. In general, the production of cellulase by fungi was preferred. As discussed in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, various microorganisms obtained domestically as well as from abroad, were screened, and Trichoderma reesei QM-9414 isolated by the U.S. Army Natick Laboratory was selected as the best strain. Mutants with enhanced enzymatic titer or with specific desirable characteristics were obtained by mutation using QM-9414 as a parent strain.
The semi-batch culture method produced a high-titer cellulase. A culture method incorporating pH shifting was employed to enhance p-glucosidase activity in Trichoderma microorganisms. In addition to scale-up experiments, cheese whey and biomass (bagasse, rice straw, etc.) were investigated as potential inexpensive carbon sources, while soybean meal and residual fermentation cells, were investigated as potential inexpensive nitrogen sources. On the basis of results obtained, a scale-up experiment was carried out in a 1-kL tank using the semi-batch culture method with 10% Avicel (crystalline cellulose) as a carbon source and soybean meal as a nitrogen source, with pH control by the shifting method. The time course of cellulase production by T. reesei CDU-11 under these conditions is shown in Fig. 3-22. High-titer cellulase activities, i.e., 720 U/ml as CMCase, 33 U/ml as FPU, 47 U/ml as Avicelase, and 31 U/ml as p-glucosidase, were obtained. Soluble protein resulting exceeded
3.5.4 Saccharification of biomass
High-concentration saccharification was conducted by the batch method. An example using bagasse as the biomass source is shown in Fig. 3-12. Low-concentration saccharification was performed by the continuous method, the volume of biomass being adjusted to between 3 and 6%. A saccharification rate of 90 to 95%, was obtained after 5 to 7 hours of reaction, with only a small amount of unreacted biomass residue remaining after the reaction. Beech chips treated by steam explosion (Temp: 220°C[2] pressure retention time: 5 min) were also subjected to the saccharification reaction for 24 hours, resulting in a saccharification rate of approximately 75 %. Table 3-7 summarizes cellulase requirements, for the saccharification of biomass, using cellulases prepared in our laboratory.
Figure 3.22 - Time course of high titer cellulase production by T. reesei CDU-11
3.5.5 Enzyme recovery from biomass
As explained in Section 3.2.1, cellulase encompasses a group of enzymes having different molecular weights. A UF membrane capable of fractionating molecular weights ranging between 10,000 and 20,000 Dalton, was therefore used to recover cellulase for re-use. While enzyme recovery from low-concentration saccharification solutions was approximately 90%, that from high-concentration saccharification solutions was approximately 75 to 80% owing to cellulase adsorption by saccharification residues. Enzyme recovery in the latter case could be markedly improved by re-slurrying the residue to extract the enzymes. In the pilot plant, tubular-type ultrafiltration equipment with a polystyrene membrane was used.
3.5.6 Concentration of sugar solutions
In order to improve the efficiency of alcohol fermentation, UF-filtered sugar solutions which were also free of enzyme were passed through a polyamide, spiral-type RO membrane, enabling them to be concentrated from between 3 and 15% to a final concentration of approximately 30%. Using this loose RO system, more than 95% of the sugar was recovered over an extended period.
3.5.7 Alcohol fermentation
The immobilized flash method was used for alcohol fermentation in the integrated pilot-scale plant. Results are shown in Fig. 3-23. Using this method, it was possible to maintain the alcohol concentration at approximately 5%, while elevating the sugar concentration of the raw material to as high as 30%. Table 3-9 compares fermentation methodologies used in alcohol production. Three immobilized yeast fermentors, each provided with a flash distillation tank, were connected in series in the pilot plant.
In order to efficiently convert xylose contained in the saccharified solutions of biomass, yeast strains were screened and Kluyveromyces cellobiovorus, a strain capable of assimilating cellobiose and producing ethanol by fermentation was newly isolated. This strain was however of poor alcohol resistance, as are other known xylose-assimilating yeast strains. The simultaneous use of the flash method was effective in minimizing the influence of alcohol and efficiently inducing the activity of this strain.
3.5.8 Alcohol recovery
Methods used for recovering alcohol included the distillation method, and the SCFE and osmotic vaporization methods.
In the distillation method, dehydrated ethanol was obtained by ternary azeotropic distillation, with benzene as a solvent. A pressure-type concentrator was employed, with steam at the top of the concentrator as an energy source for the ethanol separation column. Using this methodology, energy savings of 30% over that of the conventional method were achieved.
Figure 3.23 - Time profile of ethanol production, using the immobilized yeast and flash system
In the SCFE, ethanol obtained from the flash distillation step, ranging in concentration from 20 to 30% was brought into contact with supercritical carbon dioxide gas, resulting in 90 % recovery of 85 to 95% concentrated ethanol solutions. By optimizing the extraction pressure and temperature and, at the same time, providing a mist separator at the top of the extractor, ethanol having a composition approaching that of the azeotrope was recoverable. Impurities in the culture broth exhibited the same behavior as that of the ethanol. Studies on osmotic vaporization membrane methods for dehydration, resulted in alcohol concentrations exceeding 99.5 % at a recovery rate of at least 95 %. Analytical values for fuel alcohol obtained by the ternary azeotropic method, and by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction in combination with an osmotic vaporization membrane are shown in Table 3-10. In both methods, the water content of alcohol recovered, was less than 0.5%, indicating that
this alcohol may be feasibly used as fuel ethanol. Dehydrated ethanol produced from bagasse was mixed with gasoline and its performance as a fuel for automobiles was evaluated by Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd. Results showed no substantial difference from ordinary reagent ethanol, and the ethanol was deemed suitable for practical use.

3.6 Feasibility study
In evaluating the economy of the system employed in the integrated pilot plant, the cost and method of collecting raw biomass material must be considered. From the viewpoint of reducing the burden of biomass collection, we examined the possibility of producing fuel alcohol at a site adjacent to a cane sugar production plant. Production was evaluated based on the unit processes demonstrated in the bench-scale plant.
A cane sugar plant at Mackay, situated on the east coast of Australia, was selected as the site. The scale of the plant is as follows:
Sugar cane processed
8000 (thousand tons/year)
Production of sugar
Generation of bagasse
Generation of molasses
Alcohol production was hypothetically established on a model scale at 72,000 kL/year (alcohol concentration: 99.5%), and was evaluated both with and without the use of a highly efficient bagasse boiler.

3.7 Conclusion
Technology development for fuel ethanol production from cellulosic biomass, which is a renewable and at present unused resource has been described in this Chapter. A plant, though small in scale, capable of producing fuel ethanol was successfully constructed in our laboratory. Basic technologies, which were developed under individual unit operation conditions however need to be optimized from the viewpoint of energy efficiency. Under the present circumstances of a stable oil supply, the time may not be right to study scale-up of the process for practical application, but we believe that individual technologies developed in this work can be efficiently employed in other fields.
This study was carried out under the auspices of the Research Association for Petroleum Alternatives Development (RAPAD) with the support of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). The pilot plant for producing fuel ethanol was constructed as a joint research project by Toyo Engineering Corporation, Kurita Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd., and Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd.
Current trends in this field, are covered in publications by: C. Laluce (9), S.R. Bull (10), and M. Kuwabara (11).

4.3 Developments in bioreactor technology
References
Methane fermentation is a versatile biotechnology capable of converting almost all types of polymeric materials to methane and carbon dioxide under anaerobic conditions. This is achieved as a result of the consecutive biochemical breakdown of polymers to methane and carbon dioxide in an environment in which a variety of microorganisms which include fermentative microbes (acidogens); hydrogen-producing, acetate-forming microbes (acetogens); and methane-producing microbes (methanogens) harmoniously grow and produce reduced end-products. Anaerobes play important roles in establishing a stable environment at various stages of methane fermentation.
Methane fermentation offers an effective means of pollution reduction, superior to that achieved via conventional aerobic processes. Although practiced for decades, interest in anaerobic fermentation has only recently focused on its use in the economic recovery of fuel gas from industrial and agricultural surpluses.
The biochemistry and microbiology of the anaerobic breakdown of polymeric materials to methane and the roles of the various microorganisms involved, are discussed here. Recent progress in the molecular biology of methanogens is reviewed, new digesters are described and improvements in the operation of various types of bioreactors are also discussed.
4.1 Microbial consortia and biological aspects of methane fermentation
4.1.1 Hydrolysis and acidogenesis
4.1.2 Acetogenesis and dehydrogenation
4.1.3 Methanogenesis
Methane fermentation is the consequence of a series of metabolic interactions among various groups of microorganisms. A description of microorganisms involved in methane fermentation, based on an analysis of bacteria isolated from sewage sludge digesters and from the rumen of some animals, is summarized in Fig. 4-1. The first group of microorganisms secrete enzymes which hydrolyze polymeric materials to monomers such as glucose and amino acids, which are subsequently converted to higher volatile fatty acids, H[2] and acetic acid (Fig. 4-1; stage 1). In the second stage, hydrogen-producing acetogenic bacteria convert the higher volatile fatty acids e.g., propionic and butyric acids, produced, to H[2], CO[2], and acetic acid. Finally, the third group, methanogenic bacteria convert H[2], CO[2], and acetate, to CH[4] and CO[2].
4.1.1 Hydrolysis and acidogenesis
Polymeric materials such as lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates are primarily hydrolyzed by extracellular, hydrolases, excreted by microbes present in Stage 1 (Fig. 4-1). Hydrolytic enzymes, (lipases, proteases, cellulases, amylases, etc.) hydrolyze their respective polymers into smaller molecules, primarily monomeric units, which are then consumed by microbes. In methane fermentation of waste waters containing high concentrations of organic polymers, the hydrolytic activity relevant to each polymer is of paramount significance, in that polymer hydrolysis may become a rate-limiting step for the production of simpler bacterial substrates to be used in subsequent degradation steps.
Figure 4.1 - Stages of methane fermentation Source: McCarty, P.L., (1982)
Lipases convert lipids to long-chain fatty acids. A population density of 10^4 - 10^5 lipolytic bacteria per ml of digester fluid has been reported. Clostridia and the micrococci appear to be responsible for most of the extracellular lipase producers. The long-chain fatty acids produced are further degraded by p-oxidation to produce acetyl CoA.
Proteins are generally hydrolyzed to amino acids by proteases, secreted by Bacteroides, Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Selenomonas, and Streptococcus. The amino acids produced are then degraded to fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, and to ammonia as found in Clostridium, Peptococcus, Selenomonas, Campylobacter, and Bacteroides.
Polysaccharides such as cellulose, starch, and pectin are hydrolyzed by cellulases, amylases, and pectinases. The majority of microbial cellulases are composed of three species: (a) endo-(3-l,4-glucanases; (b) exo-p-l,4-glucanases; (c) cellobiase or p-glucosidase. These three enzymes act synergistically on cellulose effectively hydrolyzing its crystal structure, to produce glucose. Microbial hydrolysis of raw starch to glucose requires amylolytic activity, which consist of 5 amylase species: (a) a-amylases that endocleave a±1-4 bonds; (b) p-amylases that exocleave a±1-4 bonds; (c) amyloglucosidases that exocleave a±l-4 and a±l-6 bonds; (d) debranching enzymes that act on a±l-6 bonds; (e) maltase that acts on maltose liberating glucose. Pectins are degraded by pectinases, including pectinesterases and depolymerases. Xylans are degraded with a²-endo-xylanase and a²-xylosidase to produce xylose.
Hexoses and pentoses are generally converted to C[2] and C[3] intermediates and to reduced electron carriers (e.g., NADH) via common pathways. Most anaerobic bacteria undergo hexose metabolism via the Emden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMP) which produces pyruvate as an intermediate along with NADH. The pyruvate and NADH thus generated, are transformed into fermentation endo-products such as lactate, propionate, acetate, and ethanol by other enzymatic activities which vary tremendously with microbial species.
Thus, in hydrolysis and acidogenesis (Fig. 4-1; Stage 1), sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids produced by microbial degradation of biopolymers are successively metabolised by fermentation endo-products such as lactate, propionate, acetate, and ethanol by other enzymatic activities which vary tremendously with microbial species.
Thus, in hydrolysis and acidogenesis (Fig. 4-1; Stage 1), sugars, ammo acids, and fatty acids produced by microbial degradation of biopolymers are successively metabolised by groups of bacteria and are primarily fermented to acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate, ethanol, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen (2).
4.1.2 Acetogenesis and dehydrogenation
Although some acetate (20%) and H[2] (4%) are directly produced by acidogenic fermentation of sugars, and amino acids, both products are primarily derived from the acetogenesis and dehydrogenation of higher volatile fatty acids (Fig. 4-1; Stage 2).
Obligate H[2]-producing acetogenic bacteria are capable of producing acetate and H[2] from higher fatty acids. Only Syntrophobacter wolinii, a propionate decomposer (3) and Sytrophomonos wolfei, a butyrate decomposer (4) have thus far been isolated due to technical difficulties involved in the isolation of pure strains, since H[2] produced, severely inhibits the growth of these strains. The use of co-culture techniques incorporating H[2] consumers such as methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria may therefore facilitate elucidation of the biochemical breakdown of fatty acids.
Overall breakdown reactions for long-chain fatty acids are presented in Tables 4-1 and 4-2. H[2] production by acetogens is generally energetically unfavorable due to high free energy requirements (a"G^o, > 0; Table 4-1 and 4-2). However, with a combination of H[2]-consuming bacteria (Table 4-2, 4-3), co-culture systems provide favorable conditions for the decomposition of fatty acids to acetate and CH[4] or H[2]S (a"G^o, < 0). In addition to the decomposition of long-chain fatty acids, ethanol and lactate are also converted to acetate and H[2] by an acetogen and Clostridium formicoaceticum, respectively.
The effect of the partial pressure of H[2] on the free energy associated with the conversion of ethanol, propionate, acetate, and H[2]/CO[2] during methane fermentation is shown in Fig. 4-2. An extremely low partial pressure of H[2] (10^-5 atm) appears to be a significant factor in propionate degradation to CH[4]. Such a low partial pressure can be achieved in a co-culture with H[2]-consuming bacteria as previously described (Table 4-2,4-3).
4.1.3 Methanogenesis
Methanogens are physiologically united as methane producers in anaerobic digestion (Fig. 4-1; Stage 3). Although acetate and H[2]/CO[2] are the main substrates available in the natural environment, formate, methanol, methylamines, and CO are also converted to CH[4] (Table 4-3).

Since methanogens, as obligate anaerobes, require a redox potential of less than -300 mV for growth, their isolation and cultivation was somewhat elusive due to technical difficulties encountered in handling them under completely O[2]-free conditions. However, as a result of a greatly improved methanogen isolation techniques developed by Hungate (6), more than 40 strains of pure methanogens have now been isolated. Methanogens can be divided into two groups: H[2]/CO[2]- and acetate-consumers. Although some of the H[2]/CO[2]-consumers are capable of utilizing formate, acetate is consumed by a limited number of strains, such as Methanosarcina spp. and Methanothrix spp. (now, Methanosaeta), which are incapable of using formate. Since a large quantity of acetate is produced in the natural environment (Fig. 4-1), Methanosarcina and Methanothrix play an important role in completion of anaerobic digestion and in accumulating H[2], which inhibits acetogens and methanogens.
H[2]-consuming methanogens are also important in maintaining low levels of atmospheric H[2].
H[2]/CO[2]-consuming methanogens reduce CO[2] as an electron acceptor via the formyl, methenyl, and methyl levels through association with unusual coenzymes, to finally produce CH[4] (7) (Fig. 4-3). The overall acetoclastic reaction can be expressed as:
o
o
CH[3]COOH
CH[4] + CO[2]
Since a small part of the CO[2] is also formed from carbon derived from the methyl group, it is suspected that the reduced potential produced from the methyl group may reduce CO[2] to CH[4] (8).
4.2 Molecular biology of methanogens
4.2.1 Genetic markers
4.2.2 Molecular cloning of methanogenic genes
4.2.3 Genetic transformations
On the basis of homologous sequence analysis of 16S rRNAs, methanogens have been classified into one of the three primary kingdoms of living organisms: the Archaea (Archaebacteria). The Archaea also include major groups of organisms such as thermophiles and halophiles. Although Archaea possess a prokaryotic cell structure and organization, they share common feature with eukaryotes: homologous sequences in rRNA and tRNA, the presence of inn-ones in their genomes, similar RNA polymerase subunit organization, immunological homologies, and translation systems.
Recombinant DNA technology is one of the most powerful techniques for characterizing the biochemical and genetic regulation of methanogenesis. This necessitates the selection of genetic markers, an efficient genetic transformation system, and a vector system for genetic recombination as prerequisites.
4.2.1 Genetic markers
Genetically marked strains are prerequisites for genetic studies: these strains can be employed to develop a genetic-exchange system in methanogens based on an efficient selection system. Since growth of M. thermoautotrophicum is inhibited by fluorouracil, analogue-resistant strains were isolated by spontaneous mutation. Other mutants resistant to DL-ethionine or 2-bromoethane sulfonate (coenzyme M analogue), in addition to autotrophic mutants, were obtained by mutagenic treatment. Several autotrophic strains were also obtained for the acetoclastic methanogen, M. voltae. These mutant strains are listed in Table 4-4.

4.2.2 Molecular cloning of methanogenic genes
Although some methanogen genes such as amino acid and purine biosysnthetic genes, transcription and translation machinery genes, and structural protein genes, have been cloned, genes encoding enzymes involved in methanogenesis were chosen as "methane genes" here.
Figure 4.3 - C, Cycle for reduction of CO[2] to CH[4]
Methyl CoM reductase (MR; Fig. 4-3) constitutes approximately 10% of the total protein in methanogenic cultures. The importance and abundance of MR inevitably focused initial attention on elucidating its structure and the mechanisms directing its synthesis and regulation. MR- encoding genes have been cloned and sequenced from Methanococcus vanielli, M. voltae, Methanosarcina barkeri, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and M. fervidus.
Formylmethanofuran transferase (FTR) catalyzes the transfer of a formyl group from formylmethanofuran (MFR) to tetrahydromethanopterin (H[4]MPT) (Fig. 4-3, 4-2). The FTR-encoding gene from M. thermoautotrophicum has been cloned, sequenced, and functionally expressed in E. coli. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) may sometimes account for 2 to 3% of the total soluble proteins in methanogenic cultures. The two genes encoding the a± and a² subunits of FDH have been cloned and sequenced from M formicicum. In addition, the genes encoding F[420]-reducing hydrogenase (Fig. 4-3), ferredoxin, and ATPase have also been cloned.

4.2.3 Genetic transformations
A considerable amount of information relevant to natural DNA transformations of prokaryotic bacteria has been reported, and the natural competence of methanogens has been elucidated. M. thermoautotrophicum was transformed by DNA from fluorouacil resistant strains, resulting in the production of drug-resistant strains. In M voltae, auxotrophic mutants requiring histidine or purine were reverted with wild-type DNA, although the genetic transformation frequencies were very low. However, Gernhardt et al. (10) recently made a breakthrough with integration of a vector into M. voltae. Integration vector transformation techniques have been well exploited in yeasts, but not in methanogens. The hisA gene cloned from the methanogen was used as an integration site in homologous recombination. In methanococcus, a puromycin-resistant gene from Streptomyces alboniger was clearly shown to be expressed and stably maintained only under specific pressure conditions. Further characterization of
the integration mode revealed that the integration vector was tandemly repeated in chromosomal genes of M maripaludis under intensive antibiotic pressure (11). Furthermore, genomic DNA from the recipient methanogen could directly transform E. coli to ampicillin resistance, indicating that integrated plasmid vectors can be used as recoverable shuttle vectors between methanogens and E. coli.
Electroporation has also been employed for transformation with wild-type DNA in several auxotrophic mutants (CoM, histidine, and purine) with 50- to 80-fold higher efficiency than natural transformation (12). Thus, within a period of only a few years, it has become possible to exchange genomic information in methanogens, or at least in methanococci, with several genetic markers, a recoverable integration vector, and improved transformation efficiency.

4.3.2 Upflow anaerobic filter process (UAFP)
4.3.3 Anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor (AFBR)
4.3.4 Two-phase methane fermentation processes
Methane fermentation has been used since 1900 for treating excess sludge discharged from sewage-treatment plants. This technology has since been developed to treat waste waters, such as those derived from alcohol distillation, antibiotic production, and baker's yeast manufacture. However, the conventional system requires a long hydraulic retention time (HRT) due to factors such as low microbial concentration, and instability against environmental shocks.
Research and development efforts have been directed at retaining a high density of useful microorganisms, in order to achieve rapid and effective treatment, with the objective of improving the conventional system. To this end, considerable technological developments in microbial floe formation and in microbial adhesion onto carrier materials which retain cells in the reactor have been made. For the former purpose, the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) (13) has proven useful, while for the latter, the upflow anaerobic filter process (UAFP) (14) and anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor (AFBR) (15) have been developed. In all of these newly developed processes, however, acidogenesis may occur more frequently than methanogenesis, leading to the accumulation of inhibitory products such as volatile fatty acids. Two-phase anaerobic digestion processes have been developed in order to resolve this problem (16).
4.3.1 Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)
Successful construction of a UASB process capable of affording self-granulation (flocculation) of anaerobic microbes was first reported by Letting et al. (13). As shown in Fig. 4-4 (A), waste water entering from the bottom of the reactor passes through a sludge bed and sludge blanket where organic materials are anaerobically decomposed. Gas produced is then separated by a gas-solid separator and the clarified liquid is discharged over a weir, while the granular sludge naturally settles to the bottom. Granules range in size from 0.5-2.5 mm, and in concentration from 50-100 kg VSS/m^3 at the bottom, to 5-40 kg VSS/m^3 in the upper part of the reactor. Bench- and pilot plant-scale experiments indicate that it is possible to operate this system at a COD loading of 40 kg/m^3/day at HRTs of 4-24 hours. Full-scale UASB reactors are now operational in Europe, the US and Japan, with more than 100 recently constructed plants in Japan. As shown in Table 4-5 (17), the COD concentration
in the inlet waste water ranges from 2,000-20,000 mg/l at HRTs of 0.1-2 days (depending on the inlet COD concentration) in which the COD loads are 6-14 kg/m^3/day, resulting in a COD reduction of more than 80%. UASB systems are primarily used in the treatment of waste water derived from the food processing industry. Studies on the application of this system to domestic sewage, however indicate that the UASB reactor can operate at a rather long HRT of 22 hours with a relatively low COD reduction of 60-80%.
Figure 4.4 - Schematic diagram of the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB), Upflow anaerobic filter process (UAFP) and anaerobic fluidized bed reactor (AFBR) (Bowker, 1983)
Significant parameters in the UASB operation are floe diameter, microbial density, and the structure of the gas-solid separator which effectively retains the microbial granules within the reactor. The following criteria should be observed in order to achieve successful UASB operation: (a) selection of a suitable waste water capable of granule self-formation; (b) operation of the reactor without mechanical agitation; (c) start up at a relatively low COD load; (d) use of waste water containing Ca^2+ and Ba^2+ and (e) avoidance of bulking caused by filamentous microbial growth. Granule formation in a UASB system is influenced by the growth of rod-type Methanothrix spp. which produce spherical granules.

4.3.2 Upflow anaerobic filter process (UAFP)
UAFP systems were initially developed by Young and McCarty (14) using rocks and plastics for microbial fixation. These UAFP systems were applied to the treatment of domestic sewage and industrial waste waters containing relatively low levels of organic materials. As shown in Fig. 4-4 (B), the reactor contains a "medium", i.e. a microbial support. Granulated microorganisms exist not only in the spaces within the medium, but are also attached to its surface; hence, a high-density microbial population is retained within the reactor, creating a hybridization of microbial floe and adhesion. In order to avoid short-circuiting flow through the packed column, a distributor is fitted at the bottom to provide a homogeneous up-flow of waste water. At the top, treated waste water and the biogas produced are separated by a free board.
Data on full-scale UAFP systems (Table 4-5) show that alcohol distillery waste water can be treated at an HRT of 7.8 days with 74% COD removal. Application of this UAFP to domestic sewage treatment using Raschig rings (2.5 cm) as microbial supports, resulted in BOD removal of 50 to 60 % and suspended solids (SS) removal of 70 to 80%, at an HRT ranging from 5 to 33 hours.
Selection of a medium in which microbial adhesion is greatly influenced both by SS, and the chemical composition of the waste water, is extremely critical in UAFP systems. The effects of physical medium characteristics, such as size and shape, on COD removal have been investigated using modular corrugated blocks (porosity > 95%), pall rings, and perforated spheres. At a COD load of 2 kg/m/day, modular corrugated blocks exhibited superior behavior, removing 88 % of COD. A comparison of COD removal for cross- and tubular-flow systems, reveals that COD removal is 20 to 30 % greater in cross-flow systems.
In addition to plastic media, baked clay and a melted slug have also proven useful in laboratory experiments on methanogenesis from formate, acetate, and methanol. Pumice was used as a microbial supporter for methanogenesis from methanol-rich waste water of the evaporate condensate from a pulp mill (COD load: 12 kg/m^3/day, COD removal: 96%).
4.3.3 Anaerobic fluidized-bed reactor (AFBR)
A diagram of an anaerobic fluidized-bed process is shown in Fig. 4-4 (C). In such systems, the medium to which the microbes adhere is fluidized within the reactor, resulting in conversion of organic materials to CH[4] and CO[2]. Anaerobic microbes grow on the surface of the medium, expanding the apparent volume of the medium; hence this reactor is also designated an "expanded bed reactor". Use of artificial sewage in an AFBR, resulted in COD removal exceeding 80 % at 20°C, and at a COD load of 2-4 kg/m^3/day this system was tolerant of shock loading for step changes of temperature from 13 to 35°C and from 35 to 13°C. In the case of COD shock loading from 1.3 to 24 kg/m^3/day, a steady state is established after 6 days. The AFBR thus seems to be capable of performing at relatively low temperatures with both low and high COD waste waters, without significant shock loading effects.
The AFBR has been progressively developed, as shown by the full-scale operation data in Table 4-5. Engineering improvements which can potentially minimize the mechanical power required for fluidization include reduction of the expanded volume, selection of a low density medium of high specific area; and avoidance of fragility. Media such as sand, quartzite, alumina, anthracite, granular activated carbon, or crystobalite with a particle size of approximately 0.5 mm are usually employed.
4.3.4 Two-phase methane fermentation processes
Novel bioreactors for methane fermentation such as the UASB, UAFP, and AFBR experience inherent problems when operated at high COD loads, due to the fact that the overall growth rate of acidogenic bacteria proceeds faster (10-fold) than that of methanogenic bacteria. When this occurs, inhibitory products such as volatile fatty acids and H[2] accumulate in the reactor, slowing down the entire process. In order to overcome this, two-phase processes consisting of acidogenic and methanogenic fermentation's have been investigated (16).
In one full-scale two-phase system + the Anodek process (Belgium) + 70-97% COD removal and biogas production of 3-13 Kg/m^2 day with a methane content of 65 to 80% was obtained when operated at COD loads of 20-60 kg/m^3/day for acidogenic fermentation (1st phase) and 6-30 kg/n^/day for methanogenic fermentation (2nd phase). In another example, a two-phase system consisting of a complete stirred reactor for the first phase and a UASB for the second phase was constructed. When this system was applied in the treatment of alcohol distillery waste (COD =10,000 mg//) at HRTs of 16-72 hours in the first phase, and 14 hours in the second phase, 84% COD removal and 92% BOD removal were accomplished. A two-phase system consisting of a UAFP for the first phase and a horizontal AFP for the second phase has also been proposed, with which it should be possible to treat sewage waste water (COD 800 to 2,600 mg/l) at HRTs of 2-5.5 hours with a high methane content (~90%).
In addition, since SS in waste water greatly influences the performance of the UASB or UAFP, an acidogenic fermentation first phase in combination with a UASB or UAFP second phase is useful in reducing the SS which enter the second phase.

5.1 Introduction
Hydrogen gas is seen as a future energy carrier by virtue of the fact that it is renewable, does not evolve the "greenhouse gas" CO[2] in combustion, liberates large amounts of energy per unit weight in combustion, and is easily converted to electricity by fuel cells. Biological hydrogen production has several advantages over hydrogen production by photoelectrochemical or thermochemical processes. Biological hydrogen production by photosynthetic microorganisms for example, requires the use of a simple solar reactor such as a transparent closed box, with low energy requirements. Electrochemical hydrogen production via solar battery-based water splitting on the hand, requires the use of solar batteries with high energy requirements.
Low conversion efficiencies of biological systems can be compensated for, by low energy requirements and reduced initial investment costs. Moreover, in laboratory experiments, a light energy conversion efficiency as high as 7% has been obtained using a photoheterotrophic process (Fig. 5-1). The basic characteristics of biological hydrogen production and experiments designed to improve the feasibility of biological hydrogen production, particularly through the use of photosynthetic microorganisms, are described in this Chapter. Though not described in the text of this Chapter, progress has also been made in research on anaerobic fermenters (see, for example, ref. 1).
5.2 Biophotolysis of water by microalgae and cyanobacteria
5.2.1 Hydrogenase-dependent hydrogen production
5.2.2 Nitrogenase-dependent hydrogen production
Microalgae are primitive microscopic plants living in aqueous environments. Cyanobacteria, formerly known as blue-green algae, are now recognized as bacteria since the anatomical characteristics of their cells are prokaryotic (bacterial type). Miroalgae and Cyanobacteria along with higher plants, are capable of oxygenic photosynthesis according to the following reaction:
CO[2] + H[2]O ® 6 [CH[2]O] + O[2].
organic compounds
Photosynthesis consists of two processes: light energy conversion to biochemical energy by a photochemical reaction, and CO[2] reduction to organic compounds such as sugar phosphates, through the use of this biochemical energy by Calvin-cycle enzymes. Under certain conditions, however, instead of reducing CO[2], a few groups of microalgae and Cyanobacteria consume biochemical energy to produce molecular hydrogen (Fig. 5-2; 5-3). Hydrogenase and nitrogenase enzymes are both capable of hydrogen production.
5.2.1 Hydrogenase-dependent hydrogen production
Gaffron and Rubin (3) reported that a green alga, Scenedesmus, produced molecular hydrogen under light conditions after being kept under anaerobic and dark conditions.
Figure 5.1 - Components of a hydrogen production system
A 25 to 30% sugar concentration was obtained regardless of the sugar concentration of the initial saccharified solution. Table 3-8 shows the results of the RO membrane operation using filtrate derived from UF membrane-treated low-concentration saccharified solutions.
Figure 5.2 - Hydrogenase-mediated hydrogen production
Figure 5.3 Nitrogenase-mediated hydrogen production in heterocystous cyanobacteria
Hydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for this hydrogen production, catalyses the following reaction:
(2H^+ + 2X[reduced] ® 6 H[2] + 2X[oxidized])
The electron carrier, X, is thought to be ferredoxin. Since ferredoxin is reduced with water as an electron donor by the photochemical reaction, green alga are theoretically water-splitting microorganisms.
Following Gaffron and Rubin's work, basic studies on the mechanisms involved in hydrogen production have determined that the reducing power (electron donation) of hydrogenase does not always come from water, but may sometimes originate intracellularly from organic compounds such as starch. The contribution of the decomposition of organic compounds to hydrogen production, is dependent on the algal species concerned, and on culture conditions. Even when organic compounds are involved in hydrogen production, an electron source can be derived from water, since organic compounds are synthesized by oxygenic photosynthesis. The reason for hydrogenase inactivity in green algae under normal photosynthetic growth conditions is unclear. Hydrogenase is thought to become active in order to excrete excess reducing power under specific conditions, such as anaerobic conditions.
The oil crisis in 1973 prompted research on biological hydrogen production, including photosynthetic production, as part of the search for alternative energy technologies. Green algae were known as light-dependent, water-splitting catalysts, but the characteristics of their hydrogen production were not practical for exploitation. Hydrogenase is too oxygen-labile for sustainable hydrogen production: light-dependent hydrogen production ceases within a few to several tens of minutes since photosynthetically produced oxygen inhibits or inactivates hydrogenases. A continuous gas flow system designed to maintain low oxygen concentrations within the reaction vessel, was employed in basic studies (4), but has not been found practically applicable.
Greenbaum and co-workers reported very high (10 to 20%) efficiencies of light conversion to hydrogen, based on PAR (photosynthetically active radiation which includes light energy of 400-700nm in wavelength). These authors recently reported what may represent a "short circuit" of photosynthesis, whereby hydrogen production and CO[2] fixation occurred by a single photosystem (photosystem II only) of a Chlamydomonas mutant (5).
Green algae are applicable in another method of hydrogen production. The work of Gaffron and Rubin (3) demonstrated that Scenedesmus produced hydrogen gas not only under light conditions, but also produced it fermentatively under dark anaerobic conditions, with intracellular starch as a reducing source. Although the rate of fermentative hydrogen production per unit of dry cell weight, was less than that obtained through light-dependent hydrogen production, hydrogen production was sustainable due to the absence of oxygen. On the basis of experiments conducted on fermentative hydrogen production under dark conditions, Miura and Miyamoto's group (6) proposed hydrogen production in a light/dark cycle. According to their proposal, CO[2] is reduced to starch by photosynthesis in the daytime (under light conditions) and the starch thus formed, is decomposed to hydrogen gas and organic acids and/or alcohols under anaerobic conditions during nighttime (under dark conditions). The
technological merits of this proposal include the fact that oxygen-inactivation of hydrogenase can be prevented through maintenance of green algae under anaerobic conditions, nighttime hours are used effectively, temporal separation of hydrogen and oxygen production does not require gas separation for simultaneous water-splitting, and organic acids and alcohols can be converted to hydrogen gas by photosynthetic bacteria under light conditions (Section 5.3). A pilot plant using a combined system of green algae and photosynthetic bacteria was operated within a power plant of Kansai Electric Power Co. Ltd. (Nankoh, Osaka, Japan). Miyamoto and co-workers (7) recently proposed chemical digestion of algal biomass as a means of producing substrates for photosynthetic bacteria, thus improving the yield of starch degradation.
Asada and Kawamura (8) determined that cyanobacteria also produce hydrogen gas auto-fermentatively under dark and anaerobic conditions. Spirulina species were demonstrated to have the highest activity among cyanobacteria tested. The nature of the electron carrier for hydrogenase in cyanobacteria is still unclear. Hydrogenases have been purified and partially characterized in a few cyanobacteria and microalgae (9).
5.2.2 Nitrogenase-dependent hydrogen production
Benemann and Weare (10) demonstrated that a nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, Anabaena cylindrica, produced hydrogen and oxygen gas simultaneously in an argon atmosphere for several hours. Nitrogenase is responsible for nitrogen-fixation (11) and is distributed mainly among prokaryotes, including cyanobacteria, but does not occur in eukaryotes, under which microalgae are classified. Molecular nitrogen is reduced to ammonium with consumption of reducing power (e' mediated by ferredoxin) and ATP. The reaction is substantially irreversible and produces ammonia:
N2 + 6H1^+ + 6e^- ® 2HN[3]
However, nitrogenase catalyzes proton reduction in the absence of nitrogen gas (i.e. in an argon atmosphere).
2H^+ + 2e^- ® H[2]
Hydrogen production catalyzed by nitrogenase occurs as a side reaction at a rate of one-third to one-fourth that of nitrogen-fixation, even in a 100% nitrogen gas atmosphere.
Nitrogenase itself is extremely oxygen-labile. Unlike in the case of hydrogenase, however, cyanobacteria have developed mechanisms for protecting nitrogenase from oxygen gas and supplying it with energy (ATP) and reducing power. The most successful mechanism is the localization of nitrogenase in the heterocysts of filamentous cyanobacteria (Fig. 5-3). Vegetative cells (ordinary cells) in filamentous cyanobacteria carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. Organic compounds produced by CO; reduction are transferred into heterocysts and are decomposed to provide nitrogenase with reducing power. ATP can be provided by PSI-dependent and anoxygenic photosynthesis within heterocysts. Investigations into prolongation and optimization of hydrogen production, (12, 13) revealed that the hydrogen-producing activity of cyanobacteria was stimulated by nitrogen starvation.
The presence and physiological roles of hydrogenases in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria remains controversial, but 'uptake' hydrogenase appears to consume and re-use hydrogen gas, resulting in a decrease in net hydrogen production. Asada and Kawamura (14) reported aerobic hydrogen production by a nitrogen-fixing Anabaena sp., believed to be an uptake hydrogenase-deficient strain. After being cultured for 12 days, the strain accumulated approximately 10% hydrogen and 70% oxygen gas within the gas phase of the vessel, by the nitrogenase side reaction, even in the presence of air.
Miyamoto et al. (15) conducted outdoor experiments on hydrogen production by Anabaena cylindrica, in California. A nitrogen-starved culture of the cyanobacteria was continuously sparged by argon-based gas, while the hydrogen content of the effluent gas was measured. The average conversion efficiency over a period of one month (combustion energy of hydrogen gas produced by cyanobacteria/incident solar energy into the photo-bioreactor area) was approximately 0.2%.
Mitsui and co-workers extensively screened cyanobacteria for their hydrogen-producing ability, and tested Miami BG-7, one of the most potent hydrogen-producing cyanobacteria, in an outdoor culture (16). These workers also isolated a unicellular aerobic nitrogen fixer, Synechococcus sp. Miami BG043511, and with the use of synchronous culture techniques, discovered a new mechanism for protecting and driving oxygen-labile nitrogenase in non-heterocystous and oxygen-evolving cells (17). This strain is also a potent hydrogen-producer, having an estimated conversion efficiency of 3.5% based on PAR using an artificial light source (18).
5.3 Hydrogen from organic compounds
5.3.1 Hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria
5.3.2 Combined photosynthetic and anaerobic and bacterial hydrogen production
5.3.1 Hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria
Photosynthetic bacteria undergo anoxygenic photosynthesis with organic compounds or reduced sulfur compounds as electron donors. Some non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria are potent hydrogen producers, utilizing organic acids such as lactic, succinic and butyric acids, or alcohols as electron donors. Since light energy is not required for water oxidation, the efficiency of light energy conversion to hydrogen gas by photosynthetic bacteria, is in principle much higher than that by cyanobacteria. Hydrogen production by photosynthetic bacteria is mediated by nitrogenase activity, although hydrogenases may be active for both hydrogen production and hydrogen uptake under some conditions. Miyake and Kawamura demonstrated a maximum energy conversion efficiency (combustion energy of hydrogen gas produced/incident light energy) of 6 to 8% using Rhodobacter sp. in laboratory experiments (Fig. 5-4).
Figure 5.4 - Effect of light intensity on the rate and efficiency of hydrogen production in Rhodobacter species (Miyake and Kawamura, 1987)
5.3.2 Combined photosynthetic and anaerobic and bacterial hydrogen production
Anaerobic bacteria metabolize sugars to produce hydrogen gas and organic acids, but are incapable of further breaking down the organic acids formed. Miyake et al. (20) proposed the combined use of photosynthetic and anaerobic bacteria for the conversion of organic acids to hydrogen. Theoretically, one mole of glucose can be converted to 12 moles of hydrogen (Fig. 5-5) through the use of photosynthetic bacteria capable of capturing light energy in such a combined system. From a practical point of view, organic wastes frequently contain sugar or sugar polymers. It is not however easy to obtain organic wastes containing organic acids as the main components. The combined use of photosynthetic and anaerobic bacteria should potentially increase the likelihood of their application in photobiological hydrogen production.
Figure 5.5 - Free energy changes in hydrogen-producing reactions by anaerobic an photosynthetic bacteria (Miyake, et al., 1984
5.4 Enhancement of hydrogen-producing capabilities through genetic engineering
Although genetic studies on photosynthetic microorganisms have markedly increased in recent times, relatively few genetic engineering studies have focused on altering the characteristics of these microorganisms, particularly with respect to enhancing the hydrogen-producing capabilities of photosynthetic bacteria and cyanobacteria. As described in Section 5.3.2., some nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are potential candidates for practical hydrogen production. Hydrogen production by nitrogenase is, however, an energy-consuming process due to hydrolysis of many ATP molecules. On the other hand, hydrogenase-dependent hydrogen production by cyanobacteria and green algae is "economic" in that there are no ATP requirements. This mechanism of hydrogen production is not however sustainable under light conditions. Water-splitting by hydrogenase is potentially an ideal hydrogen-producing system. Asada and co-workers (21, 22) attempted to overexpress hydrogenase from Clostridium
pasteurianum in a cyanobacterium, Synechococcus PCC7942, by developing a genetic engineering system for cyanobacteria. These workers also demonstrated that clostridial hydrogenase protein, when electro-induced into cyanobacterial cells is active in producing hydrogen by receiving electrons produced by photosystems (23).
Another strategy being examined is the enhancement of hydrogen-producing capabilities of photosynthetic bacteria. In nitrogenase-mediated hydrogen-producing reactions, a considerable amount of light energy which is converted to biochemical energy by the photosystem, is lost through various biochemical processes. Control of the photosystem at an appropriate level for nitrogenase activity, would result in reduced energy losses, and thus improved light energy conversion. To this end, with the objective of utilizing genetic engineering techniques in controlling the photosystem level in the potent hydrogen-producing photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides RV, the puf operon encoding photoreaction center and light-harvesting proteins was isolated and characterized (24).
5.5 Research and development on biological hydrogen production
As explained in the introduction to this chapter, biological hydrogen production is now receiving much attention as an environmentally acceptable technology. Although a few research groups are active in basic or applied fields of hydrogen production, recent world-wide environmental problems have prompted the formation of national projects for biological hydrogen production. The German Federal Ministry for Research and Technology funded a biological hydrogen production project (1989-1994), in which universities undertook basic research. In Japan, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is promoting a project for biological hydrogen production by environmentally acceptable technology (1991-1998) through the Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE), with financial support of the New Energy and Industrial Development Organization (NEDO). The project includes development of total technologies for biological hydrogen production, the screening and
breeding of microorganisms, and basic research and development of photobioreactors and anaerobic bioreactors.
The Hydrogen Committee of the International Energy Agency (IEA, under the auspices of the OECD) has rearranged Annex Committees for hydrogen technologies. The target of Annex 10 is the photoproduction of hydrogen. This consists of three subtasks: i) photoelectrochemical hydrogen production, ii) photobiological hydrogen production, and iii) standardization. The three-year plan (1995-1997) aims to establish a closely collaborative world-wide research network to promote hydrogen production technologies.
5.6 Future prospects
Biological hydrogen production is the most challenging area of biotechnology with respect to environmental problems. The future of biological hydrogen production depends not only on research advances, i.e. improvement in efficiency through genetically engineering microorganisms and/or the development of bioreactors, but also on economic considerations (the cost of fossil fuels), social acceptance, and the development of hydrogen energy systems.

6.1 Oil substitutes from biomass
It is believed that the majority of oil and natural gas originates from algae in ancient oceans. Oil (petroleum) consists of liquid hydrocarbons which arc compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen. At least 80% w/w of oil is carbon. The remainder is principally hydrogen, but sulfur and oxygen may each account for up to 5% of the weight of oil. The burning heating volume of oil is relatively high owing to its liquid state, and is comparable to that of coal.
Total proven oil reserves worldwide are estimated to be worth the equivalent of 40 years of consumable oil, based on a 1988 worldwide oil production rate of 64.2 million barrels per day. Proven oil reserves include residual oil in oil fields where production drilling has already begun. Projected oil reserves are slightly greater than proven oil reserves, but are not however infinite. Furthermore, oil reserves are not equally distributed globally (Fig: 6-1). The Middle East has by far the world's greatest proven oil reserves. Oil production in other nations will decrease as their reserves decline, putting the Middle East in a dominant position in the oil market. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is in control of approximately 60% of the world's oil, and exercises a strong influence on oil prices worldwide. The lack of stability of future energy supplies has motivated the development of alternative energy sources in order to eliminate the possibility of
a future energy shortage.

Solar energy is renewable, whereas all other fuels including those of fossil and nuclear origin, are limited in amount and are exhaustible. One efficient method of capturing solar energy is through the use of the photosynthetic process to produce biomass (a renewable raw material resource for the production of food, fuel and chemicals) through appropriate conversions.
This Chapter examines developments in microalgal oil production. Microalgae posses several attractive characteristics:
1) Costs associated with the harvesting and transportation or microalgae are relatively low, in comparison with those of other biomass materials such as trees, crops, etc.
2) By virtue of their relatively small sizes, microalgae can be easily chemically treated.
3) Algae can be grown under conditions which are unsuitable for conventional crop production.
4) Microalgae are capable of fixing CO[2] in the atmosphere, thus facilitating the reduction of increasing atmospheric CO[2] levels, which are now considered a global problem.
Microalgal oils are produced through either biological conversion to lipids or hydrocarbons or thermochemical liquefaction of algal cells.
6.2 Microalgae as biological sources of lipids and hydrocarbons
Microalgae contain lipids and fatty acids as membrane components, storage products, metabolites and sources of energy. The chemical compositions of various microalgae are shown in Table 6-1. Algal fatty acids and oils have a range of potential applications. Algal oils posses characteristics similar to those offish and vegetable oils, and can thus be considered as potential substitutes for the products of fossil oil (2).
Direct extraction of microalgal lipids appears to be a more efficient methodology for obtaining energy from these organisms, than is the fermentation of algal biomass to produce either methane or ethanol. The lipid and fatty acid contents of microalgae vary in accordance with culture conditions In some cases, lipid content can be enhanced by the imposition of nitrogen starvation or other stress factors. In the late 1940s, lipid fractions as high as 70 to 85% on a dry weight basis were reported in microalgae. Such high lipid contents, exceed that of most terrestrial plants. The effect of nitrogen on the lipid fraction and on cell growth of the strain Nannochlolis cultured under saline conditions is summarized in Table 6-2.
Nutrient deficiencies (other than nitrogen deficiency) may also lead to an increase in cellular lipid content. Coomls, et al. (3) reported that the lipid content of the diatom Navioua pelliculosa increased by about 60% during a 14-hour silicon starvation period.

Similarly, Werner (4) also reported an increase in cellular lipids during a 24 hours silicon starvation period. The switch from carbohydrate accumulation to lipid accumulation in these diatoms occurs very rapidly, though mechanisms involved are not yet understood.
The effects of growth conditions, growth stage of algal cultures and the taxonomic position of algae, on both lipid content and lipid type, arc discussed in recent reports by Piorreck and coworkers (5, 6). According to these reports, during early stages of growth, green algae produced relatively large amounts of polar lipids and polyunsaturated C[16] and C[18] fatty acids. On approaching the stationary phase of growth, however, the dominant lipids produced by these algae were neutral, and consisted primarily of saturated 18:1 and 16:0 fatty acids. In the case of blue-green algae, the lipid and fatty acid composition showed relatively little change during the growth cycle.
In addition to nutrition, fatty acid and lipid composition and content are influenced by a number of other factors. Light enhances the formation of polyunsaturated C[16] and C[18] fatty acids as well as mono- and di-galactosyl-diglycerides, sphingolipids and phosphoglycerides in Euglena gracils and Chlorella vulgaris (7-10). Low temperatures increase the synthesis of polyunsaturated C[18] fatty acids by Monochrysis lutheri (11), and also cause changes in the fatty acid composition of Dunaliella salina (12).
Glycerol content is also influenced by culture conditions, particularly NaCl concentrations. Figure 6-2 shows the relationship between NaCl concentration, cell growth and glycerol accumulation in Dunaliella tertiolecta. The highest yield of glycerol was obtained at a NaCl concentration of approximately 2M, while maximal algal growth occurred at a lower NaCl concentration.
Figure 6.2 - Relationship between NaCl concentration and intracellular-extracellular glycerol concentration (Tanisho, 1995)
Botryococcus is a well known hydrocarbon producer. Under unfavorable conditions of growth, Botryococcus enters a stage in which its unsaponifiable lipid content increases to a level of 90 %. The bulk of the Botryococcus hydrocarbon (ca. 95%) is extracellularly located in the colony matrix and in occluded globules (13). While small amounts of hydrocarbons are produced by various algae, Botryococcus is the only alga that has been extensively investigated for its hydrocarbon-producing ability. Almost all the information collected on Botryococcus is based upon indoor algal cultivation; mass cultivation and bulk production of hydrocarbons outside of laboratory conditions, have not yet been reported (14). There are two main reasons for this. The first is the low doubling time of algae (which exceeds seven days). Owing to the energy-intensive nature of hydrocarbons, their mass accumulation in microalgae is less than that which occurs in typical unicellular green algae. However,
increased hydrocarbon productivity may be feasible by modifying culture conditions, and/or the bacterial strains used; modifications which according to the literature, result in doubling times of two to three days. Hence, it seems worthwhile to examine a variety of strains for better growth performance and productivity. The second reason being that high hydrocarbon concentrations exist only in non-growing, senescent and even decaying cultures; the hydrocarbon content of growing algae is fairly low.

6.3.1 Liquid fuels from microalgal biomass
It is well known that microalgae can assimilate CO[2] gas as a carbon source for growth. However, if the resulting cell mass is not suitably treated, CO[2] will be evolved and diluted into the environment by decomposition, thus preventing CO[2] fixation from contributing to a reduction in atmospheric CO[2].
Petroleum is widely believed to have its origins in kerogen, which is easily converted to an oily substance under conditions of high pressure and temperature (15-17). Kerogen is formed from algae, biodegraded organic compounds, plankton, bacteria, plant material, etc., by biochemical and/or chemical reactions such as diagenesis and catagenesis. Several studies have been conducted to simulate petroleum formation by pyrolysis, some of which used the marine alga Fucus sp. as the base material. Recently, activated sludge and fungi were converted to oily substances at relatively low temperatures as compared with those used in previous experimental simulations. On the basis of these findings, it is assumed that algae grown in CO[2]-enriched air can be converted to oily substances, and that such an approach can contribute to solving two major problems: air pollution resulting from CO[2] evolution, and future crises due to a shortage of energy sources. Use of thermochemical
liquefaction of organisms in the production of alternative fuels, would reduce CO[2] evolution into the atmosphere since such fuels would indeed be produced from CO[2].
Apart from the experimental simulation discussed above, other work has also been conducted with the objective of producing fuel from microalgae. Feinberg (18) reported that diesel fuel and gasoline were produced through the transesterification and catalytic cracking of lipids accumulated in algal cells. However, the raw material utilized in their work was restricted to microalgae of high lipid content. A process for the production of fuel oil from microalgae by pyrolysis has been proposed. The pyrolysis usually requires a drying procedure in which large amounts of energy are required to vaporize water. An alternative technique involving the direct thermochemical liquefaction of biomass of high moisture content, such as wood and sewage sludge, has been proposed and applied to the production of fuel oils from microalgae.
This liquefaction is carried out in an aqueous solution of either alkali or NaCl at a temperature of about 300 C and pressure of 10 MPa in the absence of reducing gases such as hydrogen and/or carbon monoxide. Since drying is not required, energy consumption for water vaporization is avoided. Microalgal cell precipitates derived from centrifugation, which are of a high moisture content, are thus good raw materials for liquefaction.
6.3.2 Cultivation of microalgae
The cultivation and liquefaction of microalgae has been recently investigated (19,20). The green microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta ATCC 30929 was cultured in a medium of the following composition: NaCl 58.5g; MgCl[2] o 6H[2]O 1.5g; KNO[3] 1.0 g; MgSO[4] o 7H[2]O 0.5 g; KCl 0.2g; CaCl[2] o 2H[2]O 0.2 g; NaHCO[3] 43mg; KH[2]PO[4], 40.8 mg; K[2]HPO[4] 0.495 g; FeCl[3] solution 1.0 ml; metal solution 1.0 ml. The FeCl[3] solution consisted of the following (per liter): FeCl[3] 0.03 g; EDTA o 2Na 5.84 g. The metal solution consisted of the following (per liter): H[3]BO[4] 0.61 g; MnCl[2] o 4H[2]O 23mg; ZnSO[4] o 7H[2]O 87mg; CuSO[4] o 7H[2]O 0.06 g; (NH[4])[6]Mo[7]O[24] o 4H[2]O 21mg; CoCl[2] o 5H[2]O 15mg; EDTA o 2Na 1.89g. The main culture was conducted in 3 L of medium at 27°C, using a 5-L fermenter (Fig. 6-3). The aeration rate and speed of agitation were maintained constant at 1 vvm and 200 rpm, respectively. Sparging gas was produced by mixing CO[2] with air at a fixed ratio
of between 0 and 0.1. Four fluorescent lamps were used for external irradiation of the fermenter; the degree of irradiation at the inner surface of the fermenter vessel was 10,000 1x.
Algae were also cultured in 20-L box-type water tanks (366 x 216 x 250 mm) containing 12 L of medium as illustrated in Fig. 6-4. The medium was not sterilized prior to cultivation. The aeration rate was maintained constant at 0.25 vvm and the CO[2] content of the aeration gas was fixed at approximately 3 %, throughout the culture experiment. The water tanks were placed either in a bio-photo chamber (max 20,000 Ix, type LX-2100, Taitec Co. Ltd., Tokyo), or on shelves with fluorescent lamps (Iwasaki Co. Ltd., Tokyo), enabling the irradiation intensity to be altered, as shown in Fig. 6-4. The initial pH of the culture broth was adjusted to 8.0 in the main culture. The innoculum volume of 400 ml, was equivalent to 3.3% of the working volume of the main culture.
The effect of NaCl concentration on growth was examined using 5-L jar fermentors. Optimal growth was obtained at an NaCl concentration of 1.0 M. In order to ascertain the effect of contamination under saline conditions, algae were also cultured at a 1M NaCl concentration in unsterilized box-type water tanks containing unsterilized medium. The vessels were not airtight, thus exposing the culture broth to contaminating microorganisms. D. tertiolecta grew to levels of 1.2 g/L and was not affected by the non-sterility of growth conditions.
Figure 6-5 shows cell growth under 5,000 and 10,000 Ix illumination in the fermenter. Growth under 10,000 Ix was almost twice that under 5,000 Ix, indicating that growth is limited by insufficient intensities of light irradiation. Light intensity is thus an important factor in scale up of the cultivation process. Cell growth within the fermenter occurred normally within a CO[2] concentration range of 3 to 10 % (Fig. 6-6). However, limited cell growth occurred at very low CO[2] concentrations (0.03% CO[2]).
6.3.3 Liquefaction of microalgae
Liquefaction was performed using a conventional stainless steel autoclave of 100-ml capacity with mechanical mixing (Fig. 6-7). The autoclave was charged with algal cells (about 20 g), following which nitrogen was introduced to purge the residual air. The nitrogen pressure was then elevated to 3 MPa, in order to prevent water present from vaporizing. The reaction was initiated by heating the autoclave to a fixed temperature, using an electric heater. The temperature of the heated autoclave was maintained constant for a 5 to 60 minute period, following which it was cooled with the use of an electric fan.
Figure 6.3 - Fermentation apparatus (5 L fermentor) used in the culture of microalgae
The separation procedure is schematically presented in Figure 6-8. The autoclave was opened, and the reaction mixture which was removed for separation and analysis consisted of a tar-like material, floating on the surface of a water phase. This reaction mixture was extracted with dichloromethane in order to separate out the oil fraction. The dichloromethane extract was filtered from the reaction mixture, following which residual dichloromethane was evaporated at 35/C under reduced pressure, yielding a dark-brown viscous material (hereafter referred to as the oil). The aqueous phase resulting after dichloromethane extraction (i.e. the dichloromethane insoluble fraction) was washed with water and filtered, in order to remove insoluble dichloromethane. The product yield in thermo-chemical liquefaction was thus calculated using the following equation:
Figure 6.4 - Box-type vessel (20-L capacity) for the culture of microalga
Figure 6.5 - Effect of light intensity on cell growth within a fermentor
Figure 6.6 - Effect of CO[2] concentration (as a sparged gas) on cell growth within a fermentor
Figure 6.7 - Schematic of autoclave equipment used for thermo-chemical liquefaction reactions
A heavy oil yield of 35.6% was obtained. This heavy oil consisted of carbon (73%), hydrogen (9%), nitrogen (5%), and oxygen (13%). The heating volume of the heavy oil was 34.7 kJ/g, which is almost the same as that of C heavy oil. This heavy oil had a viscosity of 860 cps, which was similar to that of castor oil. This heavy oil was of a higher nitrogen content than ordinary petroleum, thus necessitating requirements for flue gas treatment in order to prevent the formation of NOx.
These experimental results indicate that oil can be produced from CO2 gas using microalgae. However, two problems remain to be solved before such a system can be put to practical use. The first is the existence of a severe growth limiting factor, namely, light intensity. The effect of light intensity on growth is clearly shown in Figure 6-5; light could not penetrate deeply into the culture broth, owing to its obstruction by the microalgal body. In order to scale up algal cultivation while maintaining good growth levels, an extremely powerful light source and/or large surface area for irradiation will be required. The second problem is the high nitrogen content of the heavy oil which could be a potential source of Nox synthesis if the oil were used as a fuel. These two problems need to be addressed in the scale-up of CO[2] fixation and/or oil production using microalgae.
6.4 Algal hydrogenation
A hydrogenation process which permitted the conversion of algae (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) to liquid products (21) was also developed. Algal hydrogenation was performed batch wise, using an autoclave under high temperature and pressure conditions in the presence of a catalyst and a solvent. Major process variables in algal hydrogenation include reaction temperature, hydrogen pressure, reaction time, the nature of the catalyst, and process solvent. The effect of temperature in the reactor was investigated between 340 and 430°C, and reaction times were varied from 0 to 210 minutes. Algal hydrogenation is a three-phase operation in which contact must be established between the gaseous phase (hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases), liquid phase (mixture of solvent and liquid products), and solid-particle phase (algae and catalyst) in order to achieve algal conversion and to promote the transfer of momentum, heat, and mass.
A stirred slurry reactor, illustrated schematically in Figure 6-9, was employed to carry out the three-phase operation. The gaseous reactant was bubbled through the liquid from a sparger at the bottom of the reactor, and the solid particles slurried with the liquid were fed to the reactor. The gaseous reactant and the solid reactant (if any) first dissolve in the liquid phase and diffuse with the liquid reactant towards the catalyst. All these reactants then interact at the surface of the catalyst. The entire system was mechanically agitated by an impeller in order to enhance the rates of heat and mass transfer, to disperse bubbles throughout the agitated liquid phase, and to keep solid particles suspended in the liquid medium. The liquid products, solid particles and unreacted materials were continuously drawn off to maintain a constant liquid level within the reactor, and a constant composition in the liquid phase. Gaseous products and unreacted gaseous reactant entered
the space above the liquid surface and flowed out through a gas pipe.
Figure 6.8 - Separation scheme for liquefied microalgal cells
Algae can be converted to liquid hydrocarbons at temperatures between 400 and 430/C, and operating hydrogen pressures of 1025-2250 psig, in the presence of a cobalt molybdate catalyst. The highest oil yield obtained was 46.7 wt % on the basis of algae charged. In addition, up to 10 wt% liquid products, and 34 wt% hydrocarbon-rich gases were obtained. In general, higher temperatures and longer reaction times increase the degree of conversion and oil yield and decrease the asphaltene yield in the overall hydrogenation of algae. The oil yield and the degree of conversion also increase proportionally with hydrogen pressure to a maximum of about 1200 psig, and then level off. A catalyst is required for the algal liquefaction process, and the yield distribution from algal hydrogenation is greatly influenced by the nature of the catalyst employed. The algal hydrogenation process offers a useful means of producing liquid hydrocarbons for use as fuels, feedstocks, and chemicals.
6.5 Future prospects
Petroleum supplies will be exhausted in the future, and the development of technologies for mass production of petroleum alternatives is desired. Mechanisms of crude oil formation by natural phenomena have been partially elucidated and technology for crude oil synthesis has been developed. Several studies relevant to the production of oil using microalgae have been reported. These include hydrocarbon production by Botryococcus, thermochemical liquefaction of microalgae, and algal hydrocarbon processes, all of which were introduced in this chapter.
Petroleum is not only used as fuel, but is also a raw material for the production of a variety of chemicals. Petroleum alternatives should be developed prior to the exhaustion of petroleum supplies. The majority of petroleum has its origins in algae, which were grown using CO; as a sole carbon source. Research into the production of petroleum alternatives using microalgae is important to the future of mankind.

7.1 Introduction
Biological energy production begins with the photosynthetic fixation of CO[2] into biomass (starches, lignocellulosics, etc.) and is followed by conversion of biomass via various microbial processes to fuels (ethanol, methane, hydrogen, oils), as discussed in previous chapters. In the case of algal production of hydrogen and vegetable oils, both processes are conducted by a single organism. Even in these cases there is a clear differentiation between the photosynthetic processes of CO[2] fixation (and oxygen production) and the subsequent conversion of the fixation products to renewable fuels. The production of the waste biomass is of little concern in the conversion of waste materials, such as in methane fermentations. Still, ultimately, the source of all biological fuels is photosynthesis, carried out by plants and algae. The efficiency of photosynthesis (Chapter 2) is, thus, a central issue in the future development of these renewable biological energy sources.
Other overriding issues in the future of biological energy systems are the overall efficiencies of converting biomass to useful fuels, the economics of such processes, their environmental impacts, their competitiveness with thermochemical conversion processes for biomass (combustion, gasification), their resource potential, and, perhaps most important, their compatibility with evolving economic and political structures. Biofuels would for example, complement solar electricity in the renewable energy mix of the future. This chapter presents some projections on the development of renewable biological energy systems in the 21st Century.
The human race is already, directly and indirectly, exploiting a large fraction, almost half (1) of the total primary production of the planet - through agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and other activities. Indeed, few productive ecosystems around the world remain in their natural state, not diminished by the actions of mankind. As global ecosystem exploitation and destruction reaches its end-point sometime in the first half of the next century, and natural environments cease to exist outside a few more-or-less protected enclaves, our reliance on the bounties of nature will end. We will then depend entirely on how well we can manage the remaining biological and physical assets of our planet, to sustain the existence of a human population whose current growth rate is only exceeded by its accelerating consumption of natural resources. In addition, we will need to manage these resources within the context of a rapidly changing global environment, with unpredictable climate,
ever scarcer raw materials, and diminishing productive land, which is being covered by settlements or devastated by exploitative practices. To mention just a few of the challenges we are leaving for the next generations.
If catastrophe - economic and population collapse - is to be avoided, we must not only curb populations and consumption, but must also develop and implement more efficient and environmentally benign technologies, more available to the large populations currently not enjoying the benefits of our technological economy. Biological energy systems can play an important role in this transformation of the human economy and condition, necessary for our survival through the 21st Century.
7.2 Biomass production potential and efficiencies
Photosynthetic efficiencies are the ultimate limiting factor in biological energy production. Currently agricultural and forestry efficiencies seldom exceed 1% of total solar energy input converted to a recoverable product. However, even with current productivity's, the potential for photosynthesis to produce food, fiber, fuel, and forest products is truly enormous. Total primary productivity exceeds current fossil fuel consumption by an order of magnitude. Recently a group of experts projected the potential of improved forest preservation and management and agricultural practices to mitigate the greenhouse effect by sequestering CO[2] into long-term biomass and soil carbon and by replacing fossil fuels with biofuels. They concluded that the entire fossil fuel CO[2] emissions could be balanced with biological systems (2). In addition, this could be accomplished without diminishing the production of food, fiber, and forest products. Even conservative projections by this group
indicated that biological processes could generate greenhouse gas off-sets equivalent to almost half the current annual atmospheric CO[2] rise, and at relatively low costs. These actions do not even require the heroic measures of "planetary management" suggested by some, such as increasing primary productivity through trace nutrient fertilization of oceanic and terrestrial environments (3).
Such global projections must of course be tempered with more detailed assessments of specific local and regional possibilities of biomass energy systems. For example, in most projections of biomass systems for mitigation of greenhouse gases, it is assumed that photosynthetically fixed CO; can be sequestered for long periods (> 100 years) into above ground biomass, soil carbon, and other long-term storage forms. This is problematic, and would become a limiting factor within a few decades, as forests reach their maximum (climax) biomass levels. Thus, the major emphasis must be the development of biological energy systems that use biomass fuels to replace fossil fuels, and thereby reduce emissions of CO[2] and other greenhouse gases. Fundamental to such systems is maximizing the efficiency of the first stage of the processes + photosynthesis.
As reviewed in Chapter 2, maximal photosynthetic efficiencies are currently projected at 10% of total solar energy conversion, based on laboratory studies. In practice less than half of this has been documented in even the most productive outdoor experiments, and in plant cultivation only a 1 to 3% conversion efficiency is maximally obtained, of which less than half is typically recovered in the actual product (grain, fiber, etc.). For trees much lower productivity's are noted, in large part due to the minimal inputs (fertilizers, pest control, management) into forestry.
For microalgae systems, which are of very high productivity's, results from experimental and commercial systems are not significantly different from the more productive higher plants in similar climates. However, if laboratory results with microalgae cultures could be achieved in outdoor ponds, a 10% solar conversion efficiency should be possible, i.e. about a three-fold increase over currently achieved productivity, over 200 mt/ha/yr (metric tons/hectare/year). Why have such high solar efficiencies and productivity's not been achieved to-date?
The answer is the light saturation effect: the rate of photosynthesis does not increase with increasing light intensities. This is because at high light intensities, e.g. sunlight, the number of chlorophyll molecules absorbing a photon greatly exceeds the capacity of the photosynthetic apparatus to process this trapped energy bounty. The excess photons arc lost as heat or fluorescence, with the result that light is wasted by algae near the surface, while those below are shaded, resulting in decreased productivity's. Although this problem was recognized decades ago (4), and even the possible solutions proposed at that time, little progress has been made in this area in several decades.
One proposed solution is the use of prisms or optical fibers that transmit light to the deeper layers of the ponds. Although feasible in laboratory settings, the use of such devices is economically prohibitive. Another approach, is rapid mixing of the culture, so that, on average, after a photon has been absorbed by the photosynthetic apparatus, the algae are transferred to the dark, where they can process the photon energy at relative leisure. However, this requires such rapid mixing as to also be only a laboratory curiosity (though of great fundamental interest).
This leaves the third approach + to reduce the chlorophyll content of the algae so as to avoid, or at least minimize, photon absorption, and, thus light wastage and self-shading. A reduced chlorophyll content could be accomplished by the modem techniques of genetic engineering, and this approach presents the clearest method for achieving high photosynthetic efficiencies, approaching the theoretical maximum, with outdoor (full sunlight) algal cultures (5).
It must be recognized, however, that this would only be a first, though critically important, step in the overall effort to develop high productivity, low-cost microalgal production systems. Another step is the development of algal strains capable of producing a high yield of a desirable product, whether it be starches for fermentation to ethanol, vegetable oils, hydrocarbons, or hydrogen. Again we can invoke the powers of modem molecular biology to accomplish these goals, in particular the rapidly evolving technology of metabolic engineering, which allows manipulation and control of entire enzyme pathways. Metabolic engineering could allow for the simultaneous optimization of photosynthetic efficiencies and product formation. A two stage process would likely be optimal, similar to higher plant agriculture, where vegetative biomass production is followed by grain formation.
Low chlorophyll algal strains, and more generally, metabolically engineered strains that produce high levels of desirable products, could not compete with wild-type algae, just as crop plants cannot compete with weed species. Like agricultural systems, algal ponds suffer from invasions by grazers and diseases. A new technology of "microecological engineering" will need to be developed to prevent, if not at least minimize, such contamination and allow open pond mass culture of selected species, particularly of genetically/metabolically engineered strains. The alternative approach, closed photobioreactors, is not practical, except as a small inoculum production stage. As argued below, microecological engineering, the integration of molecular and fermentation biotechnologies with microbial ecology, will also be required in the future development of the other biological energy conversion processes addressed in this report + ethanol and methane fermentations.
Recently, Greenbaum et al. (6) reported the surprising finding that mutants of the green alga Chlamydomonas missing half the photosynthetic apparatus normally associated with CO[2] fixation and hydrogen production, still carried out both reactions at near normal rates. This suggests that algal cultures may actually require less than the 8 to 10 quanta of photons needed for reducing one CO[2] molecule to carbohydrates suggested by the accepted mechanisms of photosynthesis. Although such increased photosynthetic efficiencies remain to be demonstrated, this remind us that surprises are still occurring even at the most fundamental levels of our understanding biological processes. This also exemplifies the difficulty of projecting any future technology. In any event, the goal of achieving much higher than current efficiencies with both microalgae and higher plant, outdoors in sunlight, does appear plausible, and justifies continued and focused R&D. The insights and techniques
developed for maximizing microalgae mass culture productivity's could also be applied to higher plant photosynthesis. Although the limitations of light saturation are generally not as severe as in an algal ponds, considerable scope is available for improving the productivity of higher plant production systems. Of greatest potential, in terms of both yield improvements and increasing global biomass resources, would be the application of such techniques to forestry. Thus, microalgae systems, whose R&D can be accelerated due to their short generation times, can in the future not only contribute to the specific goals of microalgal energy systems (Chapters 5 and 6, see also below) but, perhaps most important, could also lead to more efficient, productive, and economical exploitation of higher plant photosynthesis and biological energy systems generally.
7.3 Fuel alcohol production from biomass
One of the most immediate and important applications of biological energy systems could be in the production of ethanol from biomass. In the U.S. in excess of 5 billion liters per year of ethanol fuel is currently produced by fermentations, using corn starch as the substrate. This is a conventional technology, which is economically competitive only because of the large government subsidies to encourage corn production and its conversion to fuel ethanol. Although some process improvements are possible, no major breakthroughs are foreseen, nor is the cost of corn starch likely to become more attractive, in light of the increasing food needs of the world's population. Energy and greenhouse gas emissions balances are also not particularly favorable for com-to-ethanol systems, being at best only slightly positive, and then only if more expensive, capital intensive, technology is used. Lower cost fermentation substrates and processes are required.
As reviewed in Chapter 3, lignocellulosic biomass is a potential substrate for ethanol fermentations. This requires first pre-treating the biomass to open up the lignocellulosic polymers, to allow their hydrolysis by either enzymes or acids, followed by fermentation of the hexose and pentose sugars derived from the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions, respectively. The residual lignin can be used as a boiler fuel, or as a starting material for higher value products (phenolics, polymers, etc.). Extensive research has been carried out in this field for decades (7), but practical processes have yet to be demonstrated. Indeed several problems hamper such a processes: pretreatment is cumbersome; enzyme hydrolysis is slow and requires large amount of enzymes, while acid hydrolysis is fast, but results in poor yields and many degradation products that inhibit fermentations; and the fermentations themselves are complicated by the two types of sugars present, as well as the
potential for contamination. As regards contamination, the sterilizable fermenters used in laboratory research, and even most demonstration projects, are not practical for large-scale commercial operations. In conventional corn starch fermentations, contamination is minimized by the relatively rapid batch fermentation process, selective conditions (e.g. low pH), inoculation and clean (though not sterile) start-up and operating conditions. The key problem for ethanol fermentation of lignocellulosics is the long times required for the enzymatic saccharification, which is preferred over acid hydrolysis as it results in higher yields. The exponential increase of contamination problems with cycle time, is a major limitation of the enzyme hydrolysis process.
Recently research has concentrated on the development of improved processes for enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of the pentose sugars using genetically engineered microbes (8). As in the case of microalgae culture in open ponds, microecological engineering techniques will need to be developed to maintain such strains in large systems, subject to invasion and contamination by potentially much faster growing wild microbes. Such microecological techniques would relieve the constraints of having to maximize the amounts and activities of the enzymes used in this process, or maintain strictly (expensive) aseptic conditions.
Projections of the future cost of producing ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass are as low as $0.13/liter ($0.50/gallon) of ethanol (9), compared to almost thrice this for current processes. Such low-cost projections are based on numerous favorable assumptions; one being that the same microbial culture would simultaneously provide the cellulolytic enzymes and ferment the whole suite of carbohydrates generated by enzymatic hydrolysis. This eliminates the costly enzyme production and separate fermentation stages of the process. Although such projections are very optimistic, they point out the critical R&D objectives required to achieve the very low cost processes that would make this technology viable, not only in competition with fossil fuels but also with alternative, lower cost, biomass conversion processes, such as gasification and combustion.
For the near-term future, the technology for producing ethanol from cellulosic biomass will likely begin with utilization of the most readily fermentable and lowest cost resources available, such as paper mill and food processing wastes. In the longer-term, agricultural residues, less suitable for thermochemical conversion processes because of their high ash content, are very large potential resources for ethanol production. However, this still requires a major R&D effort. Planned demonstration projects in the U.S. should allow an assessment of how far the technology has progressed, and how much it may still need to be advanced. It is difficult to predict' the relative market shares of the various technologies for lignocellulosic biomass energy conversion: combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, ethanol fermentation, or, considered next, methane fermentations. Whatever the conversion technology, in the future lignocellulosic biomass will certainly continue to be a, if not the,
major renewable energy source, as it already is for the majority of people on earth.
7.4 Methane fermentations
Methane fermentations, reviewed in Chapter 4, are currently widely used in the conversion of municipal sludge and some industrial (e.g. food processing) wastes to biogas, a mixture of methane and CO[2]. Some animal manures are also converted to biogas in developed countries (in particular Denmark) and low-cost farm-scale systems fed agricultural and animal wastes are in widespread use in some less-developed countries, in particular China and India. In addition, over the past decade several advanced processes were commercialized for the utilization of low-strength wastes (Chapter 4). Despite these applications, only a small percentage of the potential resources suitable for methane fermentations is currently utilized.
One reason for this, being that the technologies for biogas utilization have lagged behind the processes for methane fermentations (also called anaerobic digestion). Biogas is produced in relatively small amounts, so replacement of natural gas is generally not feasible, after considering the costs of gas clean-up (to remove CO[2] and other impurities) and compression. Biogas storage is generally not practical, at least not more than about one day's worth of biogas. Thus, biogas must be used essentially as and where produced. For moderate to relatively large facilities electricity generation from biogas is the best option (10). However, this requires generators, which, after capital and operating costs are considered, add about $0.025/kWhr to the price of the electricity, in addition to the cost of the biogas. Alternatively, biogas can be used as a vehicular fuel, after removing most of the CO[2] and moderate compression. Such systems have been used at several municipalities
in the U.S., and can provide cost competitive transportation fuels for specialized applications (e.g. local service fleets). However, such approaches are only suitable where sufficiently large and sustained waste resources are available, and local costs of conventional power or transportation fuels are high. For smaller-scale systems, the utilization of the biogas has to be coupled with domestic or small commercial/industrial uses, in cooking, water heating, and similar applications.
Apart from biogas utilization, the technology for its production still requires improvement, particularly for high solid, high lignocellulosic wastes and residues. Agricultural residues, just as in the case of ethanol, could provide a very large potential resource for biogas production. However high solid fermentation processes must still be developed. The highly mechanical systems currently in use in Europe for anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste are generally not practical, except where cost is (almost) no object. Low-cost, high solids methane fermentations using plastic liner-enclosed batch pits, can be considered. However, their practicality remains to be demonstrated. The management of such systems, including addition of moisture, nutrients, and inoculation with adapted microbial cultures, to prevent volatile acid overproduction (which would inhibit the process) and rate limitations, remains to be developed, as is the control of gas production to better match
biogas production with utilization.
Biogas production is certainly the simplest, potentially lowest cost, biological energy production process, compared with the other technologies highlighted in this report. The large greenhouse effect of methane gas, some ten times that of CO[2], makes any mitigation (capture, use) of anthropogenic sources of methane, such as from animal wastes, even more valuable than other biological energy sources, which mitigate CO[2] emissions by replacing fossil fuels. Thus, biogas technologies, including recovery of gas from landfills and from animal manure, should receive additional consideration based on this benefit.
Methane fermentations require the development of microecological engineering techniques geared toward predictable, controlled, maximal gas production, better fitting production with utilization. Such process control techniques could initially best be applied to stirred tank fermenters and the innovative and multistage continuous hydraulic processes reviewed in Chapter 4. Additionally, hydrogen fermentations should be included in this management concept, either for the production of methane-hydrogen mixtures for vehicular fuels (a volumetric mixture of about 70:30 CH[4]:H[2] significantly reduces tail pipe emissions) or even production of pure hydrogen (11). The greater challenge will be the development of process control techniques for high solids batch processes or covered lagoons, systems which provide both the largest future potential and greatest technological challenges for methane fermentations.
7.5 Fuels derived from microalgae
Microalgae mass cultures have been considered for almost fifty years as potential biofuel sources, with the first conceptual engineering analysis presented in the late 1950's (12). Initially proposals were for the production of biomass suitable for methane fermentation in combination with waste water treatment (13). More recently, emphasis has been on higher value fuels, particularly hydrogen (11, 14, see Chapter 5) and vegetable oils (15, see Chapter 6), in stand-alone energy production systems, preferably coupled to utilization of CO[2] from power plants. Compared to other biological energy systems, either combined with waste conversion or as stand-alone systems (growing of energy crops followed by utilization as, or conversion to, fuels), microalgae systems are relatively undeveloped, requiring longer-term R&D.
In the case of hydrogen production by microalgae, two fundamentally different processes can be considered: those involving direct electron transfer from water to hydrogen, or indirect processes, in which first CO[2] is fixed into a fermentable substrate, which then is converted to hydrogen via algal metabolism (16). The former approach suffers from the oxygen sensitivity of the hydrogen evolution reaction, among other limitations, while the latter is more complex, requiring multiple stages and more challenging metabolic control. A recent economic analysis of a large-scale (over 100 hectares) two-stage indirect process, concluded that this concept had economic potential, with costs projected at $12 to 15 per million BTU (million British thermal units) (17). Direct biophotolysis systems would be more expensive, as the entire surface area would need to be covered in closed photobioreactors, vs. only one tenth of this for two-stage process. The above cost estimate was based on a
10% solar conversion efficiency in the first (CO[2] fixation) stage and a 100% solar conversion efficiency in the second (H[2] evolution) stage; ambitious, but not unreasonable long-term R&D goals. (In the second stage most of the energy comes from stored starch, allowing for such high solar efficiencies). Of course, this is a largely conceptual process at present, although based on known metabolic processes in microalgae.
Apart from photosynthesis, the hydrogen evolution reactions themselves must also be efficient. This eliminates, almost a priori, the enzyme nitrogenase in hydrogen production, as this enzyme has a high ATP requirement + reducing efficiencies by about half. Although the reversible hydrogenase enzyme has a much higher inherent efficiency, high yields with this enzyme remain to be demonstrated. In dark anaerobic fermentations of organic substrates to hydrogen, yields are low, typically 20% or less of stoichiometric (18,19).
By contrast, photosynthetic bacteria can convert many organic substrates, including waste materials, stoichiometrically to hydrogen (and CO[2]), assisted by light energy. These high yields have made this process a subject of much R&D. Unfortunately these bacteria use the nitrogenase enzyme, lowering potentially achievable solar conversion efficiencies. Similarly, most research on indirect hydrogen production by cyanobacteria has used nitrogen-fixing species. In the future, microalgae that produce hydrogen via a reversible hydrogenase should be favored. In any event, photosynthetic hydrogen production will require long-term R&D. Among the many challenges the design of closed, low-cost, photobioreactors, in which the light-driven hydrogen evolution reactions would take place, is of importance.
Similarly, the production of lipids, that is vegetable oils and hydrocarbons, by microalgae is a long-term R&D objective. Essentially a similar two-stage process to that conceived for hydrogen production could be envisaged: in the first of which algal biomass would be produced, followed by a lipid induction stage. Both stages would however be open ponds, of much lower cost than the closed photobioreactors envisioned for the hydrogen production stage discussed above. Lipids would be used as vehicular fuels, either directly or after processing to "biodiesel" (methyl or ethyl esters). The CO[2] required for growing the algae would be obtained from power plant flue-gases, or similar sources. Thus, this process would be a method for directly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Although likely more expensive than most other biomass energy systems, microalgae ponds provide one of the lower cost methods for directly utilizing and mitigating power plant CO[2]
emissions, compared to other options such as ocean disposal (15).
Microalgae biotechnology has advanced considerably over the past few decades, from a laboratory curiosity to relatively large-scale (> 10 hectares) commercial systems based on open ponds and, in total, producing several thousand tons of biomass. However, this technology is only in its infancy. Only two algal species, Spirulina platensis and Dunaliella salina, can be cultivated outdoors with assurance, by providing chemically selective growth media (high bicarbonate and salinity, respectively). Cultivation of high-lipid microalgae in open ponds has been successful at the 0.2 hectare demonstration-scale (20), but remains to be developed as a practical process. By combining such processes with other objectives, in particular waste water treatment and the production of higher value products, including foods and chemicals, nearer-term development and applications of microalgae processes for renewable energy production are likely.
7.6 Conclusions
The biofuels discussed above and in prior chapters are only a few of the renewable energy products that can be produced with higher plants and microbes. Plant and algal photosynthesis is the engine that drives the global biological carbon cycle, which greatly exceeds the fossil fuel carbon cycle, while providing us with all our food and forest products, and, even today, a significant fraction of our fiber and fuel needs. There is great potential for a major expansion of biomass systems, both for "green energy" and for other renewable resources. Such expansion must primarily come from increases in productivity, i.e solar conversion efficiencies, without, however, as has been the case in the "agricultural revolution", increased fertilizers, chemicals, and other non-renewable inputs into the cultivation systems.
Microalgae can help guide the way to these objectives, by demonstrating the fundamental approaches to increasing photosynthetic efficiencies. Microalgae production systems can also lead in the development of microecological engineering techniques, required to achieve the process stability and low costs in "open" microbial processes for production of ethanol, methane, and hydrogen from conventional biomass sources. Microalgae processes, combining waste treatment with the production of higher value products and renewable fuels, can demonstrate how multipurpose/multiproduct systems maximize environmental and economic benefits, compared to dedicated, single purpose, energy farming systems.
The future success of biomass energy products will depend on their economics, relative to the competitive costs of other sources. Currently biomass energy sources are generally not economically competitive, due to the low prices of fossil fuels. However, low fossil fuel prices are due not only to the low cost of extracting fossil fuels, but, and perhaps most important, to the fact that their prices do not reflect their true costs: to the environment, society, and our future. These "externality" costs of fossil fuel resources are paid by all, in particular future generations, in environmental degradation, climate change and unsustainability of our economic systems. Although biomass energy systems are already competitive with fossil fuels in some specific cases, major expansion of renewable bioenergy will require not only advances in technology but also in economic accounting of their lower environmental and societal costs, compared to fossil fuels.
Of course, bioenergy systems have actual and potential environmental impacts of their own. Agriculture and managed forestry represent the largest-scale human intervention, often wholesale destruction, of natural ecosystems, leading to loss of their benefits, from biodiversity to management of the hydrological cycles (1). Adding to this environmental insult the injury of large-scale, intensive biomass systems, could make their environmental impacts greater than even those of fossil fuels. However, there is another way: the development of sustainable, multi-purpose, integrated biomass systems, based on highly efficient photosynthesis and microbial processes, generating a variety of products, including fuels. Such systems have the potential of reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture and forestry, while providing the food, fiber and even much of the fuel, required for an acceptable standard of living for all of mankind in the 21st Century.

The energy crisis of the 1970s was followed by increased concern for the environment, with particular emphasis on protection of the global ecosystem. This bulletin describes alternative methods for the production of energy from biomass. The potentials and limitations of plant and bacterial photosynthesis and methodologies for improving biomass energy production through microbial conversion processes are also discussed.
