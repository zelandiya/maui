<title>The Political Economy of the Common Market in Milk and Dairy Products in the European Union. (FAO Economic and Social Development Paper - 142)</title>

Preface
The study of policy implementation mechanisms or policy delivery systems, as separate from policy formulation, is a generally neglected area in economics, and specifically agricultural economics. Nevertheless, the policy delivery system can be of critical importance for the effectiveness of policies in reaching their objectives, whether explicitly stated or not. Frequently deficiencies or problems in the mechanisms for delivery of a policy can seriously reduce its impact, if not bring about an altogether different outcome from the intended one. In any case the modalities and mechanisms for delivery of a policy are likely to have a significant impact on the effects of the policy. There is no doubt that the area of policy delivery is one with significant potential for analytical developments and which can possibly have very significant implications for the fields of policy design and policy advice.
The present study constitutes an attempt at applying a conceptual framework for analysis of policy delivery systems to a specific case: the common dairy policy of the European Union. This latter is an area of considerable interest in its own right, both because of the analytical interest presented by the complex mechanisms for regulating the internal EU market for dairy products and because of the impact of the policy both on the EU and international markets. It is however, also of major interest in the context of a discussion of policy delivery systems because it represents a case (along with the other agricultural market policies of the EU) where a common policy across the entire EU is to a large extent implemented at the national level by national institutions. You thus have a case of one policy implemented through different policy delivery systems, making it eminently suited for an analysis of the importance of the policy delivery system as such. The study analyses the
common dairy policy of the EU, it outlines its objectives as well as the basic principles of the support system, and discusses the framework for its implementation as well as the practical implementation. The general discussion is accompanied by three case studies on the implementation of the policy in three different EU member countries, allowing to assess how the impact of the policy can differ according to the nature of the policy delivery system. The performance of the policy delivery systems in meeting the objectives of the policy is assessed. The study is further enriched by some concluding considerations on the future of EU milk policies in the light of the constraints imposed by the likely EU enlargement as well as current and possible future WTO agreements.
To sum up, I believe that the present study presents a dual interest. Its careful discussion of EU milk policies is of interest in its own right, but the originality of the study derives from its focus on the importance of the policy delivery system and the comparative analysis it provides in this regard. I believe that the type of analysis conducted and the conclusions reached provide material for reflection on the importance of the hitherto far too neglected area of policy delivery.

I. INTRODUCTION
The starting point for this study is a paper presented by Sandiford and Rossmiller at the Agricultural Economic Society's meeting at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England in March 1996 - 'Many a Slip: Studying Policy Delivery Systems'. The paper is appended as Annex I. In their paper Sandiford and Rossmiller discuss the change in the theoretical approach to the analysis of public policy in the last two decades as a result of a shift towards public choice theory which stresses the self-interest of groups who forge alliances to further their own ends. This has become an alternative to the traditional normative welfare approach. Sandiford and Rossmiller's examples are concerned with the fact that advice and analysis usually concentrate on the policies themselves and their apparent results. There is in the authors' view a growing tendency for the "distancing" of policy making and advice from policy implementation with the increasing tendency to employ non-governmental agencies in "the
policy delivery system" (PDS). The system of policy implementation is in the authors' view a neglected area and their concern is to contribute "towards a framework for structured thinking about policy delivery systems" to improve the relevance and practicability of advice.
Sandiford and Rossmiller suggest the adaptation of the so-called "structure-conduct-performance paradigm" (S-C-P) from the industrial organisation literature. Starting with a description of the policy-making process itself, there should then be an analysis of the stated policy objectives and the manner of their agreement as "an exogenous reference point". There needs to be clarity about what it is intended to achieve and the degree of commitment of those who wish to achieve it. Analysis should then move to the policy delivery system (PDS) and the functions that agents in the structure of the system are intended to perform in implementing the policy. This should be followed by analysis of the actual conduct of policy by agents in the PDS to pinpoint any differences between intended and actual behaviour. Finally, there is the assessment of the performance of the policy in meeting its original objectives and delivering benefits to the "targeted recipients", which, it is argued,
should be done by reference to four criteria: effectiveness, efficiency, equity and enforceability - the four Es. The authors stress the complexity of the task of assessing performance and some of the difficulties of interpreting their criteria. There is overlap in these criteria, and in the real world bureaucrats and politicians (Adam Smith's "crafty and insidious animals", Smith [1976. IV.2.39]) are forced to trade off one against the other. It will be argued in this study of European dairy policy that particularly has this been the case as the policy has developed over the years.
Sandiford and Rossmiller's paper deals mainly with the theory of the new general approach to policy analysis, but it also attempts to apply the method briefly to three examples. These relate to 1) agricultural statistics collection in Korea, 2) agricultural input supply in Korea and 3) export crops in Sierra Leone. It has been suggested that adaptation of the 'new institutional approach' to policy making and its extension to policy delivery provides a structured framework for studying the European dairy policy and its delivery across countries. An attempt will accordingly be made in this paper to apply the framework first in a general overview of the development of the dairy policy and its delivery across what has now become 15 member states. Policy agreed at the European level after reconciliation of conflicting interests may be implemented differently with differing results in member states. To study such matters in more detail this paper will consider the policy delivery
system in three countries as sub-case studies. The three countries chosen are Italy, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The interest in these countries lies in the fact that the Netherlands is one of the original Six with the least exceptions from Community norms, whilst the other two countries have market and processing industry structures that are different from the rest of the European Union members and where the policy itself has had to be sometimes cumbersomely adapted to cope with these exceptions.
Milk policy in the EU and Sandiford and Rossmiller's paper both have an intrinsic interest which might be reason enough for looking at one through the other. There is, however, more than methodological interest in bringing the two together. It will be argued at the end of this study that during the first half of the 21st century, with the likelihood of further GATT rounds concluding along the lines of the 1992 agreement, dairy policy is likely to become "globalised" rather than merely turned into a laissez-faire system. Not only therefore will the numerous new regional international organisations, free trade areas and preferential groupings that have come into existence in recent years face problems similar to the EU but so will the new World Trade Organisation (WTO). Sandiford and Rossmiller's intention was to provide an adaptable methodological framework for development assistance projects, and such like. Application of their approach in the complex area of milk policy and
co-ordination of national policies may have wider benefits.

II. THE THEORY OF ECONOMIC POLICY ANALYSIS
No attempt will, or need be, made at a comprehensive survey of the extensive and growing literature on the modem institutional approach to the analysis of economic policy. A few remarks, however, may help to put this study and the Sandiford and Rossmiller paper into perspective and draw out the distinction particularly between public choice theory and the traditional marginalist approach.
The orthodox approach to economic policy concerns itself with the maximisation of "economic welfare" which is said to be optimised by free-market forces in a position of general equilibrium. In the real world, market failures and imperfections occur, such as sharp fluctuations in prices, which give wrong signals to producers, and "externalities", which are costs that individual producers impose on the rest of the economy but that play no part in their output decisions. The intervention in the real world by a benevolent government is assumed to be able to correct or improve matters through the use of policy instruments at its disposal -taxes and subsidies, tariffs, intervention buying, expenditure on research, etc. These are instruments that can be employed only by governments and should be designed to do the least possible damage to non-beneficiaries whilst moving the economy as a whole towards maximum gross domestic product (GDP) and optimum "economic welfare".
The above description of the working of the market mechanism and the functions of government sets the scene for the tasks of economists and government advisers. Their job is conceived as offering impartial advice to politicians that will minimise any damage to those adversely affected through interference with the market whilst at the same time maximising the benefits to immediately interested parties and secondary groups. The policy is to be judged as efficient in so far as its costs (e.g., to tax payers and-other damaged parties) are minimised whilst the benefits of increased net income overall are maximised.
This kind of thinking as a method of analysis is recognisable as one applied by most practising economists and also as one that politicians for their part have come to expect of their advisers. The technical literature is extensive, and some of it familiar, and need not therefore be quoted as it is associated with the writings of well-known names in economics - Pigou, Pareto, Samuelson and many others.
An alternative approach to economic policy and complementary to that of Sandiford/Rossmiller is contained particularly in the writings of Professor James Buchanan. In his book The Limits of Liberty - Between Anarchy and Leviathan' [1975] he puts forward a contractarian theory of public choice. Subsequent articles elaborate and refine the approach (Buchanan [1975a], [1987] and [1988]). Buchanan does not quarrel with maximising models in economics for the analysis of the firm and consumer behaviour. He argues, however, that it is inappropriate to extend this approach to policy acts or what he calls 'social organisation'. "This is a bridge which economists should never have crossed and has created major intellectual confusion". (Buchanan [1975a]).
The main message is that policy making has to be viewed as a continuous process rather than as single acts. The analysis, therefore, distinguishes between the constitutional contract, which governs the whole process of law and policy making, and individual instances of policy making within the constitution. The constitution sets the general expectations of action by the regime within which interest groups can work. It also sets limits within which individual policies can be prescribed.
Constitutions and the rules they lay down for individual acts change very slowly and thus are generally incomplete. They define individual rights and in economic terms give rise to the existence of property. They define and also limit rights of enforcement by the state. Individual policy acts, however, have to complement and fill gaps in the constitution, and to this extent the distinction between the constitutional contract and individual policy acts is often blurred since the policy act may provide a wide measure of interpretation of parts of the constitution. The lesson for would-be economic advisers to be taken from Buchanan is that in almost no circumstances will they start with a clean sheet to correct some example of market failure. Economists, therefore, should consider the economic problems of governments not as agents seeking to maximise "economic welfare" but as arbitrators, seeking to work out compromises between conflicting claims. Many economic principles will
still apply, but it becomes necessary to go inside the process of policy making and delivery to examine the reactions of all the agents within the process and study their motivation.
Applying this approach to the European Union, it can be said that the Treaty Establishing the European Community (Rome 1957) and the Treaty on European Union (Maastricht 1992), and the various amending Treaties together provide the constitution of the Union for making individual acts of common policy (in the form of Regulations, Directives or decisions of the Council of Ministers or decisions of the European Court). Complexity, however, arises in the EU in that member states themselves have a diversity of political 'constitutions' ranging from the 'Westminster system' of the United Kingdom to different types of written constitution in other states and all of these have long histories and traditions surrounding them. Whilst the Treaties require national legislation to be harmonised so as not to impede the establishment of the Common Market (largely completed by 1992), the implementation of policy within member states still depends on governments and agencies that are
dependent on the traditions of past policies and the national legislation of member states. There can be no doubt that in the implementation of the common dairy policy these differences have played a part. Pressure from the centre, i.e., from the Commission in Brussels, has not always been successful in preventing some divergences, although it can be said that the continuous process of policy making seeks to reduce divergence whenever it is practical.
It might be said that the paper of Sandiford and Rossmiller, whilst welcoming the context-specificity of the new institutional economics, which they say "is refreshing and encouraging for us as policy practitioners", is also suggesting and inviting the development of a partial integration with aspects of 'marginalism' in their discussion of performance criteria - the four Es, effectiveness, efficiency, enforceability and equity. Some discussion of each of the four Es is necessary.
Effectiveness Effectiveness for Sandiford and Rossmiller is a sine qua non of performance criteria, in their words a 'top level criterion'; a necessary even if not a sufficient criterion to which the others are to be seen as 'second level'. One could just agree and pass on. If a policy does not achieve agreed objectives then it clearly would not matter whether it is efficient in any sense that could be found. In the European Union matters may not always be so straightforward. As a collection of member states, the degree of commitment to the objectives of a particular policy will almost certainly vary, and even compromise of objectives may be sought between members in both ex ante and ex post discussion. Clarity, therefore, in analysis of objectives of a policy needs to go hand in hand with analysis of the political process and the kind of priority which member states are likely to give to one policy compared with another. Obviously ex post assessment will be highly dependent
on information systems set up at the beginning (or information already collected on a continuing basis), but such material is not costless, and when separate agreement is necessary for its collection this also becomes a test of the commitment to the objectives. Information can often (indeed should) alter the position of parties with strong, weak or little commitment to the objectives, and they are likely to act accordingly in the defence of their interests.
Efficiency Sandiford and Rossmiller argue that a clear distinction has to be made "between the costs of the policy itself and the costs of delivering the policy". The former can be taken to be the total cost of the policy in terms of its cost effects on all gainers and losers in the economy as a whole. The costs of delivery would be the implementation costs of all agencies in the delivery system affected by the policy and might include inefficiencies through mismanagement, fraud or "leakages" often not set out in "official costs". Economists normally assess costs of a policy comparatively, that is to say the costs of a policy might be assessed in relation to the market ideal or in relation to an alternative policy to achieve the same objectives and the results it might be assumed to deliver. With alternative policies one can consider efficiency in terms of the ratio of benefits to the intended recipients over the total cost to the community as a whole. The policy where this
ratio is shown to be highest is then judged the most efficient. Most economists are used to this form of argument and presentation, but it has to be admitted that it is never straightforward and is subject to a wide area of judgement and conjecture.
The new institutional approach to industrial economics and industry organisation makes use of the concept of transaction cost first introduced into economics by Professor RH Coase [1937]. In a now very well-known article the reason for the existence of the firm is ascribed as being due to the avoidance of transaction costs inherent in the market mechanism itself. Within the firm, resources are allocated and output levels decided by the co-ordinating decisions of the 'entrepreneurs' but without the costs of contract and marketing. Changes in industrial structure are thus regarded as the result of extending the avoidance of transactions costs and carrying out more co-ordination within an organisation without reference to the market. For many years Professor Coase's idea was neglected, at least as a research agenda. In recent years (especially following Buchanan's work and recent attention to the writings of RH Coase) the literature has grown. (A good textbook source on modem
industrial organisation theory is Hay and Morris [1992] and a collection of seminal articles can be found in Buckley and Michie [1996].)
The main interest in Coase's general idea and approach for present purposes is its extension in the political sphere. (A study of the "transaction cost" concept applied to politics is contained in A.K. Dixit [1996].) A policy might be judged as totally efficient in benefiting a targeted group when all parties are likely to vote for it. When the unanimity rule is applied to voting for a policy and the policy is accepted, the presumption is that there are no losers. Conversely, when unanimity breaks down there is assumed to be inefficiency. On the surface at least this is a very simple position which might easily be extended a step further to say that the more unanimity breaks down and the lower the majority required in a decision-making rule, the more inefficiency there is likely to be (for detailed discussion see Buchanan [1975 ch.3] where it is argued that the cost of a unanimity rule is often extremely high or prohibitive which makes 'a qualified unanimity rule' necessary
for practical decision-making).
Any application of this approach to policy in the European Community and especially to the dairy industry needs great care. It will be found that policies in the dairy business which do not give rise to much controversy between beneficiaries and other parties in some member states of the EU do, nevertheless, give rise to considerable controversy in other member states.
Enforceability The examples used in the Sandiford/Rossmiller paper are all of policies being applied in a single State. In the ultimate, compliance in a single State depends on the ability of the State to punish citizens for non-compliance. Punishment for recalcitrants has to be seen to be sufficient to provide effective deterrent. The punishment for government, on the other hand, is either rebellion or loss of control if a sufficient number of its citizens refuse to comply, or in a mature democracy, in which the rule of law is accepted by the vast majority, the removal of the government from office and the reversal of policy over time.
The problem of international enforceability of policies in groupings of States with Treaty arrangements is less clear-cut. The issue is, nevertheless, crucial for international organisations to which member states have accepted treaty obligations. The European Community's experience in the co-ordination of economic policies (especially in difficult areas like milk) is therefore of wide interest.
First, it should be noted that the European Union's main institutions, the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors, do have wide powers that are defined in the Treaties. The Council can legislate on a proposal from the Commission (after advice) by qualified majority voting to obtain information. The Commission has wide powers to obtain information from member states to issue opinions (Article 169) on matters of infringement and to take member states to the Court of Justice. Member states may take other member states to the Court if they think an infringement has affected their interests (Article 170). If the Court finds on a referral that there has been an infringement, it has unlimited powers of fine within the proportionality limits of the case. The ability to obtain information to expose an infringement thoroughly and to do so reasonably quickly could be said to be the first necessity for enforceability. The power
of the Court to fine means, moreover, that the penalty is directly targeted at the transgressor in the Community, unlike agreements that simply permit retaliatory action by a wronged party which then has side effects on others.
Quick exposure and fines proportionate to the damage done are sufficient means of enforcement for nations observing the international rule of law and the contract of the Treaty. Why should there not be a parallel in the extreme case between governments of the citizens' rebellion? The answer to this question must rest on the principle of reciprocity. If rebellion by a member state on one policy puts in danger the Treaty arrangements as a whole, the losses involved become much greater than the losses for a particular group from complying with an unpopular policy. The European Union has no procedure for withdrawal, and the negotiation of withdrawal would certainly be very tough for an individual nation. Break-up of the EU would seem difficult to conceive unless its larger members were in agreement and were then to conclude bilateral arrangements with one another. Given, however, that the EU is also part of the GATT (now WTO), the practical difficulties would be of gigantic
proportions if descent into anarchy is to be avoided. Ultimately, therefore, enforceability rests on the fear of the damage that would be done to all nations in a situation of anarchy, or the damage done to a single nation if it were isolated from the international community.
The rules provide for moving forward as much by agreement as possible, and the EU seeks to do so. The Council may act on a qualified majority as laid down in the weighted voting rights and majority rule set out in the Treaty (Article 148). However, under what is known as the Luxembourg Convention of 1966, when member states have declared a policy to affect their vital interests, they have been able to exercise at least a temporary right of veto. This position was established by France after the so-called "empty chair" period in the latter half of 1965 in a dispute between the Commission's first President, Walter Hallstein, and the French government. The Luxembourg communique in January 1966 placed the onus on the Commission to seek discussion and modification of its proposals until members' vital interests are met. Whilst 'vital interests' are not defined, the use of such devices certainly does not avoid conflict, but does help to avoid decisions that are likely to become
unenforceable. Perhaps a key practical outcome of the dispute was that for more than 20 years the Commission tended not to take important political initiatives to be settled in Council by qualified majority voting, but to put forward such matters only after prior consultation with the governments of member states.
Equity However a majority voting system is constructed in a free society, when there is a strong dissenting minority decisions might often be regarded as provisional or subject to modification as majority and minority groups change over time. Whilst a firmer consensus can sometimes emerge, it is the case that strong underlying ethical and equity considerations rooted in the EU in the history of national development of policies can make convergence difficult. A prime ethical consideration, for example, that has influenced the development of the Common Agricultural Policy from the very beginning is that it is based on the family farm. The guiding principle on which the original Six were able to agree upon unanimously was that, in the words of Sicco Mansholt, the Dutch Commissioner for Agriculture at the time, when speaking to the Stresa Conference in 1958, ".... sound.... family farms, really constitute from both the technical and the economic angle and naturally from the
political angle too, the essential foundation of agriculture in Western Europe". Whilst the Treaty of Rome itself in spelling out the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy (Article 39.1) does not mention the family farm, there is no doubt that the needs of the family farm have been seen as paramount to the "harmonious development of economic activities.... continuous and balanced expansion.... (and)....accelerated raising of the standard of living...." (Article 2) that the Treaty was brought into being to promote. As the original Community expanded, and particularly with the entry of the United Kingdom in 1973, the unspoken ethical base of Community thinking on agricultural policy was not unanimously accepted. The objectives of Article 39 were of course part of British legislation (in very similar words), but it is fair to say that policy for family farms had been almost peripheral to British agricultural policy rather than central to it. In British thinking on
agricultural and trade policy the needs of the consumer have always been paramount. In any trade-off, therefore, between equity and efficiency in agricultural policy, the outlook of the original Six and the United Kingdom has been very different. Britain and the other member states of the Union have lived with this fundamental difference in outlook for more than two decades. But in more recent debate over closer union of European nations, it has begun to emerge how different are attitudes to many of the aspects of social security policies and hence priorities in provision for health care, unemployment pay, pensions etc. Provision varies enormously and priority differences lie deep in national consciousness and the history of established rights. Such differences are now giving rise to acute problems in harmonising government finance, debt management, etc, necessary to the achievement of monetary union which the revision of Article 2 in the Maastricht Treaty sets as the
Community's revised task.
Making this fundamental point about the ethical notions of fairness behind policy is not to deny that there are other aspects that we need to consider in relation to equity as a performance criterion for agents in the policy delivery system. In the EU, with its support price mechanisms, it may be considered whether prices to farmers across the Community are reasonably similar or whether part of the cost of support is being creamed off by unintended beneficiaries? Whilst this might be partly an efficiency matter, it is also a matter of equity if detailed rules adopted work differently in different areas and therefore deny access to intended benefits under the policy. Equity is also concerned with consistency and impartiality of agents in the system, which in a very large area like the EU is more difficult to achieve than in a smaller union.
In examining the European dairy policy from the perspective of the theory discussed in this section and in the Sandiford/Rossmiller paper, the subject will be broken up into parts. After an outline of the EU policy-making procedures and an analysis of the policy objectives for agriculture and the milk sector, the price support policy for milk will be summarised as it currently stands. A summary will then follow of other policies for the milk sector to complete the single milk market and to control surplus. The paper will then consider the detailed implementation of the policy in the milk sector across the Community and in the countries used as case studies. This will be followed by an economic analysis of the policy within the framework of theory in the Sandiford/Rossmiller paper. Finally, an attempt will be made to draw some conclusions and pointers for dairy policy in the future in an enlarged European Union and the world as a whole.

III. THE DECISION-MAKING MACHINERY OF THE EU
The primary impetus to European Union after World War II was political -to reconstruct a Europe which would remain at peace, under democratic control, and free from any re-emergence of dictatorships. The chosen means of economic integration and union has been a long road in which the interests of many parties and the clash of opposing national interests have been (and still are being) gradually fought out. One might say in the language of the contractarian theory of public choice, already discussed, that economic union was intended to limit public choices through the voting rules and the creation of the Community governmental institutions of the Treaty of Rome so that the worst of all "political failures" of the 20th century could not happen again.
Interest in the differences over the fundamentals of policy in the EU has tended to focus at least since the Treaty of Accession in 1973 on the United Kingdom's relations with the rest of the Union. It has begun to be forgotten that in the early stages of the formation of Community policy, and in the formation of the CAP in particular, it was the clash between France and West Germany, the two largest member states of the original Six, which occupied the centre of attention. As an agricultural-importing country, the creation of an internal free market in agricultural produce put greatest pressure on Germany and her farmers as prices, particularly for cereals, in Germany were the highest. Other member states were looking to the creation of a common market in agricultural produce to replace German imports from third countries with their own exports. In the battles over the establishment of common prices, the only route to the establishment of common threshold and support prices
in all main markets in which regimes were established was to fix them at the level in the highest member states, which in most cases was the German level. A similar problem occurred in 1969 after the boom in the Germany economy created pressure for a revaluation in the Deutschmark which threatened to lower Community agricultural support prices (calculated in Deutschmarks) in Germany. To support the interests of German farmers in this case, the Community invented the device known as "monetary compensatory amounts (mcas)", which effectively formed a tax on imports into Germany equal to the amount of the revaluation and a similar subsidy on German produce being exported. (After the move to flexible exchange rates in 1971 mcas began to be fixed weekly to match any moves in currency markets.) German protectionist policies and the struggle for self-sufficiency in agriculture are deeply rooted, and control over these policies was sacrificed with reluctance for the industrial
economic advantage of the common market (see Hendriks [1991] for an extended historical account).
In many ways the UK situation as an agricultural-importing nation was similar to that of Germany except that the UK had other obligations to the Commonwealth as a supplier of agricultural products. Politically the UK also saw itself (in the early post-war years especially) as a major power having a "special relationship" with the United States. By the late 1950s such notions had changed and the US keenness for UK membership of the European Community began to be heeded. The British proposal for a gigantic industrial free trade area that omitted agriculture was a failure. The limited Free Trade Area Agreement that followed the breakdown of negotiations for British entry to the Community in 1963 was a stop-gap measure and an irrelevance that delayed the eventual negotiations for entry in 1973.
These brief remarks on a few of the events of history serve to demonstrate the clash of interests there is in Community economic policy making even when statements of aims and objectives may not give rise to much difficulty given the skill of diplomatists and civil servants in drafting them. The neat division in the European Union between the "constitutional contract" and individual policy acts (discussed earlier) might be said to be affected by the fact that the Treaty arrangements since the founding Treaty of Rome (1957) have been under frequent review as the Community has been enlarged and its internal institutions and arrangements have developed. Moreover, when the intention has been to create a framework for a managed market, single policy acts require constant adjustment: only thus can such acts cope with problems of enlargement, and changes in the market situation arising from changes in consumer demand, as well as rapid technological and structural change in all
aspects of production and marketing. The sheer necessity to respond to change creates opportunities for agents in the system to try to influence policy decisions in ways that are favourable to their interests.
The decision-making process of the European Union when it is laid out in detail is very complex because of the numerous links that exist in the system. Indeed, it might be said that it is the very existence of some of the international links in the system that gives rise to political tension in the domestic policies of member states. Such links may tend to break the sovereignty of the parliaments of member states. Parliaments have found a weakening of their control over Ministers when decisions are taken in the Council of Ministers. The legislation of national parliaments can be overthrown by citizens' right of access to the European Court thereby reducing control of citizens by governments. Issues arising in these ways often cut across traditions of party politics in member states and even render them irrelevant, which leads to a sense of frustration and dissatisfaction. These remarks might be read in the press of most countries at some time or other as they relate to many
issues in the everyday life of ordinary citizens throughout the Union.
An attempt has been made in Chart 1 to portray the system and the links in it. Many books set out diagrams of the system similar to Chart 1 - none is completely satisfactory. The following paragraphs are a brief sketch of the operation of the system¹.
(¹I have used "European Union Selected instruments taken from the treaties" Book 1, Volume 1 published by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities 1995 for quotation.)
The key institution of policy making for the European Union is the Council of Ministers which consists of the Ministers of member states for whatever matters are being discussed, e.g., agriculture, transport. The Council legislates by means of Regulations and Directives, both of which are binding in member states. Regulations specify the means and often involve the Commission in administration, while Directives leave the methods of achieving the policy prescription to member states themselves. The Council can also issue Decisions, which likewise have binding force on governments, large enterprises and organisations. The Council acts by qualified majority (Treaty of Rome, Article 148) except in cases where there is a vital national interest or in other cases where unanimity is required. The Council also has a Committee of Permanent Representatives of Member States (COREPER) whose responsibility is to prepare for the work of the Council and to carry out tasks assigned to it by
the Council. These tasks are frequently to find solutions to problems on which the Council have been unable to agree.
An extension of the Council of Ministers is the European Council which effectively is a Council meeting involving the heads of governments accompanied by Foreign Ministers and other Ministers as required. It is in these meetings (usually held three times a year) that large issues such as the need for changes in the Treaty arrangements, changes to the Commission's "own resources" and issues that cannot be resolved in ordinary Council meetings are dealt with. Some decisions affecting the dairy industry have had to be taken at this level, e.g. the introduction of the quota policy, the Italian quota issue, the decisions relating to BSE and the ban on British beef exports. Changes in Treaty arrangements requiring unanimity and ratification by the parliaments of member states have to be dealt with at Inter-Governmental Conferences (IGCs).
The Council of Ministers acts only on the basis of proposals made to it by the Commission. The Commission's primary tasks are to ensure that the Treaty and measures taken by institutions pursuant to it are applied, and to formulate policy proposals to the Council (Article 155). The Commissioners themselves (there are 12 at the present time) are nominated by the governments of member states, and the Head of the Commission is chosen and agreed upon by the European Council after consultation with the European Parliament. The Head of the Commission allocates portfolios to the Commissioners nominated by members states' governments, which are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament. These are delicate matters in many areas but not least in agriculture. The Agricultural Commissioner's job has frequently been given to a Commissioner from one of the smaller states: the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland and, at the present time, Austria. Commissioners nominated by
member states are not representatives and are required to give "a solemn undertaking" to serve the general interests of the Community and be completely independent when taking up their duties (Article 157 (2)).
The Commission can make proposals only after it has consulted the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee. The European Parliament is a directly elected body. Its chief function is advisory, but it has the power to question Commissioners, and receive reports from them as well as an annual report from the Head of the Commission. Its proceedings are public and published. It has the power to pass a motion of censure on the Commission which, if carried by a two-thirds majority, requires the Commission to resign as a body (Article 144). The Single European Act (1992) and the Maastricht Treaty gave the European Parliament limited power of amendment of Council legislation in certain areas relating particularly to transport, environment and consumer protection (but not agriculture). The last word in cases of dispute is left with the Council after reference to a conciliation committee, but the Council is then required to act under the unanimity rule and not by
qualified majority voting; without unanimity the Council is required to accept Parliament's amendment.
Under Article 113 of the Treaty of Rome the Community took responsibility for negotiating common commercial policies with the rest of the world, a logical extension of the establishment of the common external tariffs. This area of activity, which has devolved on the Commission, has become very important as the task of conducting increasingly complex negotiations for Community enlargement, the Uruguay Round of GATT, co-ordination of sanctions policies, the disposal of large surplus stocks, and aid policies to the developing world extend well beyond tariff or commercial policies. To deal with such matters Article 113 has been revised and extended in Article 228 by the Maastricht Treaty to give the Commission, the Council and its committee the necessary legal power. Whilst this work has enhanced the Commission's status, it still acts after the submission of proposals on such matters to the Council (Article 113 (2)) and in consultation with a special committee appointed by the
Council (Article 113 (3)) to assist it. The work of the Commission in this area, it should be said, has been of considerable importance over the years to agriculture, including the dairy sector which has been affected by enlargement, sanctions, deals on surplus stocks, food aid, terms of entry of foods from third parties, and the 1992 GATT Agreement.
The Economic and Social Committee, with many sub-committees covering the various specialised sections of its work, is an advisory Committee appointed by the Council from lists of names provided by member states. The names submitted, twice as many as the available seats, are from all walks of life but are supposed to "consist of representatives of the various categories of economic and social activity" (Article 193).
Around the central process of Community decision-making through its principal institutions there is considerable opportunity, particularly in agriculture and the dairy sector, for the activities of pressure groups and "industry experts" (usually the representatives and employees of powerful organisations in the industry). Farmers' unions are represented in Brussels through the activities of COPA (Committee of Agricultural Producers' organisations in the EC) and co-operative marketing organisations are represented through COGECA (the General Committee for Agricultural Co-operatives in the EC). The dairy trade also has a European organisation, (EDA-formerly ASSILEC) the European Dairy Association, with representatives in Brussels. Each of these bodies is able to obtain representation on the Commission's Milk Advisory Committee, and through this channel farmers and industry marketing organisations can exercise influence on proposals to be made to the Council as well as on the
implementation of policy by the Commission. Arguably links with these bodies are part of the Commission's antennae of information in understanding the way its proposals are expected to work on the ground. Even when there is industry opposition, these direct links between the Commission and industry are important for the Commission in preparing and arguing its case.
A final point should be observed in relation to the decision-making process, particularly as it relates to agriculture. Every year the Commission is required to make proposals for the review of farm prices and support arrangements. These proposals are invariably controversial and often very hard fought, both within the Council and outside in the other advisory institutions, and also through wider public debate. The result is that the review proposals are usually presented as a package of measures as the only means of achieving reasonable consensus. Essentially this means give and take, or a kind of market trading in political decisions. There has to be something favourable to everyone even though many pills have to be swallowed. Clearly there is much scope for skilled negotiation and guile by politicians and bureaucrats, but the reality of this process has to be understood every bit as much as the formal decision-making rules and the democratic process they seek to establish
in the system.

IV. THE AIMS OF POLICY FOR AGRICULTURE AND THE MILK SECTOR
The aims of policy in the milk sector are very specifically linked to the fulfilment of the aims for agricultural policy as a whole set out in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome. The aims of the policies to establish a common market in each of the main agricultural commodities for which a support price regime exists are set out in the Preamble to the Regulations and in the Articles of the Regulations themselves. In the case of milk the basic Regulation to establish a common price regime is Council Regulation (EEC) 804/68 which was enacted on 29 June 1969. Although there have since been more than 50 amendments to this Regulation that have changed most its 37 Articles, the Preamble and Article 3, which deal with its aims, remain unchanged. The Preamble contains 19 paragraphs, several of which for present purposes need to be looked at in some detail.
The specific link between Regulation (EEC) 804/68 and the aims of the Treaty of Rome (the "contract obligations" in Buchanan's terminology) is made in the words of the Preamble where they are associated with the principal elements of the system.
- Whereas the aim of the Common Agricultural Policy is to attain the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty; whereas, in the milk sector in order to stabilise markets and to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community concerned, it is necessary that the intervention agencies continue to take intervention measures on the market, such measures however to be standardised so as not to impede the free movement of the goods in question within the Community.
- Whereas intervention measures must be such that the proceeds of aggregate milk sales tend to correspond to the common target price for milk delivered to dairy; whereas, to that end, in addition to intervention in respect of butter and fresh cream, other community intervention measures are required to enable the best return to be obtained from milk proteins and to support the prices of products which have special importance in determining producer prices for milk.
- Whereas the creation of a single Community market for milk and milk products involves, apart from a single price system, the introduction of a single trading system at the external frontiers of the Community; whereas a trading system including levies and export refunds, combined with intervention measures, also serves to stabilise the Community market, in particular by preventing price fluctuations on the world market from affecting prices ruling within the Community; whereas therefore provision should be made for the charging of a levy on importing from third countries and the payment of a refund on exports to such countries, both being designed to cover the difference between the prices ruling outside and inside the Community.
It will be noticed that the above paragraphs single out some of the objectives mentioned in Article 39 of the Treaty for reiteration but not others. They do not reiterate Article 39.1 (d) and (e) "to assure the availability of supplies" (the Six were more than self-sufficient in milk in 1969) and "to ensure... supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices". They do, however, repeat 39.1 (b), the need "to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community concerned" in identical words. It might be noted here that in this repetition it stops short of the last phrase of Art. 39.1 (b) which reads "in particular by increasing the individual returns of persons engaged in agriculture". The import levy/export refund system is specifically related to Article 39.1 (c) the need "to stabilise markets" which the Preamble then spells out in detail.
The price of milk is critical to the incomes of small family farms in the northern part of the Community, and it would seem to be a fair reading of the aims of the policy for price support in the milk sector as set out that the first and main objective is income support "for the agricultural community concerned". This is the target group of beneficiaries and this interpretation is totally consistent with the remarks quoted earlier of Mr Sicco Mansholt at the Stresa Conference in 1958. The other emphasis in the Preamble is on the free movement of goods within the Community's borders. The Preamble in its penultimate paragraph reiterated once again the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty and also Article 110.
- Whereas the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products must take appropriate account, at the same time, of the objectives set out in Article 39 and 110 of the Treaty;
The latter article emphasises that the free movement of goods within the Community will increase the competitive strength of undertakings within member states. In other words, by freeing trade between member states and creating a single European market, the marketing chain would be made more efficient through its exposure to competition. The support per se is aimed at achieving "a fair standard of living for the agricultural community concerned".
As the policy of creating a single market is aimed at promoting competition and therefore reducing marketing margins, it might be said that it is also seeking to promote the objective of reasonable prices to consumers. Whilst this aim is easily deducible, it is not spelt out and repeated several times in the same way as the objective of support for farm incomes. Indeed, it would be easy to show how most of the documents emanating from the Commission in the last twenty years reviewing progress and dealing with reform of the CAP have given much space to the analysis of farm incomes.
It is not intended to review the immense amount of literature and discussion documents on the farm income problem and the difficulties for policy in dealing with it. A good discussion (with a long bibliography) can be found in Berkeley Hill [1989] in which the problem is discussed both for the Community and other countries, some now in and some outside the Community. That the Community objectives in policy statements for farm incomes are vague is now well understood. The Community has never defined "income" for farmers, nor the "agricultural community" to which income is related. Nevertheless, considerable effort is spent in collecting data on farm accounts from which a whole series of definitions of "farm income" can be devised. The Farm Accountancy Data Network for the Community (FADN) defines farm types on a consistent basis across the Community and the samples collect data on a consistent accounting basis for each type; but in an area as large as the Community farm type
and different income definitions can have widely differing significance in different regions. The most difficult technical problem is the sampling of farms of any type or within any region which, if done non-randomly, can give useless results. That Community policy, however, does not define the "agricultural community" it is seeking to support is also fundamental. Structural change is reducing the number of farmers and farm families rapidly, and those farms that remain are getting larger. This affects the average farm income as a statistic, but pays no attention to the fact that some of those that grow through amalgamation achieve satisfactory income, while those that do not sink into poverty and eventually leave the industry. The numbers involved in milk production have shown a sharp decline in every country, whilst average herd sizes have grown.
Putting these difficulties to one side, it will be accepted for present purposes that the targeted group of beneficiaries of the policy for the milk sector are the producers of the basic commodity behind the farm gate. The other prime aim is the establishment of a free market in milk and milk products with no barriers to trade within the Community's borders. Apart from the abolition of tariffs and all border taxes, the Articles of 804/68 in the early years sought to dismantle all special local marketing arrangements for liquid milk and related products in order that there should be no distortion of competition in the production of the intervention products, as well as products that were more widely traded than liquid milk. The prices to producers throughout the Community would then reflect closely what was intended in the support system. The creation of such a single market in milk and milk products was intended to have the favourable effect of increasing the competitive
strength of organisations in the marketing chain and hence promote improved efficiency between the farm gate and the consumer. Benefits would be felt in lower prices to consumers or in reductions in the cost of support or both.
At this point we might take note once again of the political decision-making process in the EU in the enactment of policy. The Council of Ministers that enacts policy for agriculture is the Council of Agricultural Ministers who answer for their governments particularly to their agricultural populations. In many EU countries and especially in key areas the agricultural population is a politically sensitive group, which has often given Ministers of Agriculture a big role in government. The exception is the United Kingdom where the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food retains Cabinet rank now mainly because of his importance in EU Council decisions. Given this political position, it is not surprising to find the emphasis in the statement of policy aims being on farm incomes (albeit vague) with the aims of establishing the single market being more muted or just implied.
The most precise statement of the aim of the price policy regime for the milk sector is that:
"...intervention measures must be such that the proceeds of aggregate milk sales tend to correspond to the common target price for milk delivered to dairy:..."
This aim is further specified in Article 3:
1 "...a target price for milk shall be fixed for the Community in respect of the milk year....
2 The target price shall be that which it is aimed to obtain for the aggregate of producers' milk sales on the Community market and on external markets during the milk year.
3 The target price shall be fixed for milk containing 3.7 percent fat, delivered to dairy."
Whatever the vagaries in the income objectives of the Treaty and in measuring the improved competitive strength and efficiency of marketing organisations through the creation of a single market, the narrower aim of the milk policy to achieve a Target Price (determined at the beginning of the year) for milk of 3.7 percent fat delivered dairy is quite specific. It is only qualified in the Preamble wording by the phrase "tend to correspond to the target price..." and in Article 3 by the words "aimed to obtain for the aggregate of producers' milk sales" (my italics).
From an analyst's viewpoint the level of conjecture is at least narrowed down. So far as the data permit for member states and organisations, producer milk prices can be compared with the Target Price to test whether the principal stated aim of policy is being achieved. Data on "the proceeds of aggregate milk sales" for the Community as a whole do not exist, but at least a qualified judgement can be made from the use of Eurostat farm price statistics supplemented by other data. Nevertheless, the drafting of the Regulation is sufficiently flexible to allow policy makers some escape if the Target Price is not always achieved everywhere within the Community - the Target Price is the aim of policy but not guaranteed.
Article 39
1 The objectives of the common agricultural policy shall be:
(a) to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour;
(b) thus to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular-by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture;
(c) to stabilise markets;
(d) to assure the availability of supplies;
(e) to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.
Article 39 of the Treaty is reproduced above partly for ease of reference, and because it is central to the study and understanding of policy. One of the themes of this study in the examination of the Preambles to the Community's legislation in the conduct of policy is that the secondary aims of policy have shifted over time. Whilst the core aims of the Treaty remain, the aims in legislation reflect not merely the changing market circumstances but also the changing political groupings and subsidiary aims of national participants that have influenced the conduct of policy. This applies, for example, to the enlargement of the Community, particularly in 1973, when, with the accession of the UK, the Community took a different view (as will be seen later), on policy towards liquid milk pricing. A change of emphasis is also seen in the introduction of quotas, which took considerable political manoeuvring to achieve. The Commission regarded quotas as the only means left to
safeguard the core aims of the Treaty. Germany and the Netherlands wanted quotas; the UK wanted to control budget spending; France and Ireland did not want quotas at all; whilst Italy hardly took the debate seriously until the very last minute. (For an account of the position taken by all parties to the debate between July 1983 and March 1984 see Petit, M. et al [1987].) The Maastricht Treaty of European Union also shifted the ground somewhat as it specifically linked agricultural policy to the achievement of closer economic integration and social cohesion through the reduction of "disparities between the levels of development of various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions including rural areas" (Article 130a). The FEOGA budget is one of the Community Funds to be used to support the achievement of these objectives (Article 130b).
Perhaps, the most fundamental change that has still to be worked out in terms of the conduct of policy for milk is the EU's Schedule of Commitments in the Agreement on Agriculture in the 1992 Uruguay GATT Round. The Community has agreed to a reduction in "the aggregate measure of support" over five years; to "tariffication" of its variable levies with a five year reduction programme; to a quantitative restriction on the payment of export refunds; and to market access for importers increasing from a minimum 3 percent to 5 percent of total milk requirements in six years starting from 1995/96. These matters, together with the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures which is intended to subject barriers to trade by these means to more rigorous discipline and scientific investigation, are likely to have a considerable impact on the conduct of policy in the EU milk sector. The GATT Agreement in Agriculture is itself the result of extreme political pressures brought upon
the Community from both groups within and other Contracting Parties without who seek to gain by modifying the CAP. The results have still to be worked out, but the core aims of the EU constitution in Article 39 and more recently in Article 130 will remain. These matters will be examined further in the final chapter of this study.

V. AN OUTLINE OF THE EU SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR MILK
This chapter will give a detailed outline of the price support system itself, as set out in the basic Regulation (EEC) 804/68, and refer to its pre-history and some of the main developments of the policy since its inception.
It took the original Six members of the Community eleven years to achieve a common policy for milk and the other major commodities of cereals and beef. In the milk sector each member state had differing levels of protection for milk producers and different methods of achieving it. In Germany and the Netherlands the liquid milk market and the manufacturing or industrial milk market were separated with elaborate methods of pooling prices between the two to obtain the producer price. In order to establish free trade within their borders the Six had to harmonise support prices and intervention measures, eliminating border taxes and controls between themselves in transitional steps, and establishing a common level of tariffs on imports of dairy products from third countries in matching steps. Export refunds had to be established and harmonised pari passu. The transitional system introduced a mechanism with a set of intra-Community levies on trade to be gradually eliminated in a
series of steps as external tariffs and internal intervention measures were harmonised. Agreement in this process was achieved by the gradual alignment of the level of protection afforded by measures in the highest-price country. The predecessor to the current Regulation which the Community adopted to carry this out was Regulation (EEC) 13/64, and the transitional period was completed in the four years from 1964 to 1968.
Regulation (EEC) 804/68 has three major Titles. Title 1 deals with prices and the fixing of the actual level of support (Articles 2-5). Title II deals with the Intervention System (Articles 6-12). Title III deals with Trade with third countries' (Articles 13-21) and Title IV deals with "General Provisions" (Articles 22-37), the establishment of a Management Committee, the rules for authorising producer bodies, such as the UK Milk Marketing Boards, the rules governing aids, etc. The principle policy matters under each Title will be dealt with in turn.
Title I. Articles 2-5 of the Regulation require the fixing by the Council for each milk year of a Target Price for milk (of 3.7 percent butterfat), an intervention price for butter and skimmed milk powder (and intervention prices for Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses) together with threshold prices for "pilot products", which give the required level of protection for the Community processing industry that will enable the prices of imported milk products to correspond to the Target Price for milk.
The annual fixing of the Target Price determines the overall level of support for milk producers - the "targeted beneficiaries" of the system. The fixing of intervention prices (and, following them, threshold prices) influences the prices of the range of dairy products in the market place according to the amount of fat and solids-not-fat contained in them. In the ten years from 1984/85 to 1994/95 the Community have reduced the ratio of butterfat to solids-not-fat support from around 70: 30 to about 42: 58. This has tended to lower butter prices and cream prices in the market whilst increasing the price of skimmed milk powder. Liquid milk prices can be affected between whole milk and skimmed milk, and small differences can be made in cheese prices according to compositional variations and types. Producer payment systems, which in most countries are geared to paying on the basis of fat and protein composition of milk, are also affected by this ratio which in turn affects
feeding and breeding regimes on farms. Finally, the budget cost of support is also affected by the Community's handling of this ratio through the cost of subsidised disposal schemes for butter and skimmed milk powder. In practice, changes in the ratio have been a complex process of balancing the budget cost of support (the skim powder market is expensive to support) against the market need for lower butter prices and the conflicting interests of all parties in the system. (Butterfat, for example, is less difficult for farmers to control in the short term through feeding than protein and solids-not-fat.)
Because of the acute problems of surplus that emerged in the first half of the 1980s and the financial burden thus imposed, the Community introduced a quota system for five years with effect from 2 April 1984 to "re-establish balance in the milk sector" by a method that "despite the administrative difficulties which its implementation may involve (is) the most effective method, and the one having the least drastic effect on the incomes of producers..." (Preamble Regulation (EEC) 856/84.) Each Member State was allotted a "guaranteed total quantity" which was based on deliveries to dairies and direct sales by producers in the calendar year of 1981 with the exceptions of Ireland and Italy, whose total guaranteed quantities were based on the calendar year 1983. Each Member State was required to opt for one of two formulas for distribution of "reference quantities": Formula A and Formula B. Formula A distributed reference quantities directly to individual producers whilst Formula
B distributed reference quantities to individual purchasers. The policy was effected by alteration and addition to Article 5 of 804/68.
An additional levy was introduced ('the super-levy') on all sales that exceeded reference quantities in a 12-month period. As the policy developed the system was made tougher and a super-levy of 115 percent of the Target Price became payable on all milk over-quota once allowance was made for producers who under-produce. To produce milk and deliver it above quota puts producers at high risk of effectively paying a fine when the price of the milk paid by the dairy was nothing like 115 percent of the Target Price, and in many cases well below the Target Price. The system was certainly effective in keeping the majority of producers within their quotas. Quotas were reduced in stages in 1987/88 and 1988/89 and were only exceeded for the Community as a whole after the chaos of the first year, marginally in 1990/91. (Details of implementation will be discussed in Ch. VIII.)
Title II (Articles 6-12) lay down the policy of intervention purchases for butter and skimmed powder (and speciality cheeses in Italy). The intervention agency is to be designated by each member state and those agencies shall buy in product offered to them provided it reaches certain standards (e.g., produced by an approved manufacturer, meets standards of keeping quality, be of a minimum fat content and maximum water content). Disposal of product by intervention agencies must take place in ways that "avoid disturbing the balance of the market", e.g., food aid; exports with Community subsidies; sales to non-profit making institutions, or the food processing industry, or for animal feed in the case of skimmed milk powder-markets that can be isolated and separately identified and do not undercut general full-priced sales.
After quotas had been reduced and the Community's massive stockpiles of butter and skimmed powder had fallen, the Council took steps to limit the availability of intervention. In March 1987 Article 6 of 804/68 was modified to enable intervention purchases of butter to be suspended as soon as stocks exceeded 180 000 tonnes. Similarly, intervention buying of skimmed powder was suspended for the winter period (September-February) and only available for the period 1st March to 31st August until stocks reached 106 000 tonnes. If the suspension of intervention buying lowered market prices to 92 percent of the intervention price for butter in "a representative period" in any member state then tenders for purchase by the intervention agency in that member state were to be allowed. The buying-in price to be fixed by tender was not to be less than 90 percent of the intervention price. The aim of modifications to policy in these ways was to bring pressure on marketing agencies to shift
milk away from intervention products as demand fell for those products and move it into the manufacture of products (especially cheeses) for which demand was rising. Clearly this policy would save budget cost and also speed up reaction in the industry to changes in market demand when the overall supply of milk was being held down by quotas.
Title III (Articles 13-21) lays down the policy for trading with third countries. Imports into the Community and exports from it of dairy products are controlled by licences. Levies are charged on imports of milk products by licensees. In July 1995, as a result of the GATT Agreement in the Uruguay Round, the levies were converted to tariffs. Dairy products are divided into groups of "pilot products" and the levy (now tariff-equivalent) calculated as the difference between "free-at-frontier" prices for those products and the most favourable price for the product in international trade. Export refunds (now fixed) were similarly calculated for the Community as a whole but also varied according to the destination of the product or its use. In a situation in which world market prices for one or more pilot products rises "substantially above" threshold levels, which then threatens the stability of the Community market, the Council is required to take steps to deal with the matter.
Finally, Title IV of Regulation (EEC) 804/68 provides a "sink" for "General Provisions". A key provision in this section of the Regulation is the establishment of a Management Committee and the rules for running it. Article 29 of the Regulation establishes the Committee and requires it to consist of the representatives of member states and to be presided over by a representative of the Commission. Voting is by qualified majority, weighted as in Article 148 of the Treaty of Rome. The Commission shall submit draft measures to the Committee which is required to adopt an opinion by a minimum of 62 votes cast under qualified majority voting rules. The opinion has to be adopted within a time limit determined by the Commission according to the urgency of the matter in hand. The Commission may then adopt measures (e.g., issue Regulations, Directives, opinions) if there is a majority opinion in the Management Committee or on its own authority if the Committee has not adopted an
opinion in the time period set.
Amongst the miscellaneous provisions of the final Title are the conditions which a member state must fulfil in order that a producer organisation with "exclusive rights of purchase in an area" may be established. As this applied only to the United Kingdom and was intended to legalise the Milk Marketing Boards, it will be dealt with later in discussion of the implementation of the Community policy in the UK.
The above paragraphs in this section are intended to provide an outline of the policy and something of the history of its development. The policy itself is immensely detailed and controls the whole system of milk production and marketing in all its aspects from the farm to the consumer. A necessary part of the creation of a single market for milk, which took the community many years (until 1992), was the adoption of common Health and Hygiene Directives which lay down common sanitary standards in the production and handling of milk and milk products at all stages. Without common standards in this area the creation of a single market with the same rules for competitive operations throughout is impossible. Whereas harmonising price support by raising it to the level of the highest presented a route to agreement, harmonising sanitary standards to either the highest or the lowest presented quite different problems. In general common health and hygiene standards on farms and in
dairies have been agreed at or near levels of the highest, but the time period necessary was very long and it was achieved in a period when there was in any case great pressure in the Community to reduce support prices.

<section>8</section>
VI. OTHER ASPECTS OF THE POLICY FOR THE MILK SECTOR
There are several other aspects of milk sector policy that have played a key role in the attempt to fulfil the overall aims that need to be outlined briefly before turning to implementation. These are the policy for the liquid market, Regulation (EEC) 1411/71, which establishes "additional rules on the common market organisation in milk and milk products for drinking milk" and the policies for so-called "co-responsibility" (Regulation (EEC) 1079/77), which establishes a levy on producers to be used for measures to expand the market for milk and milk products, and the various "outgoer schemes" for assisting farmers by means of compensation to leave milk production.
Issues relating to the drinking-milk market were politically very sensitive from the beginning. Products in this area "form a substantial source of income for farmers", whilst at the same time products in this category "also have great importance as basic foodstuffs for the whole population (and)... are subject to special quality requirements". (Preamble to 1411/71.) The most basic aim of the policy was expressed in Article 2.1 of the Regulation:
"The common policy applicable to the products specified.... shall be so implemented that the greatest possible quantity of milk is consumed in the form of these products".
The situation in the early 1970s was that most of the drinking milk sold was standardised at some level in each of the original six member states and there was no commonality. The butterfat levels in milk and the range of fat in drinking milks varied in every state. The Regulation therefore established four types of milk:
raw milk
milk which has not been heated or subjected to treatment having the same effect;
whole milk
milk which has been subjected to at least one heat treatment or an authorised treatment of equivalent effect by a milk processor and has a fat content of at least 3.5 percent;
semi-skimmed milk
milk which has been subjected to at least one heat milk treatment or authorised treatment of equivalent effect by a milk processor and whose fat content has been brought to at least 1.5 percent and at most 1.8 percent;
skimmed milk
milk which has been subjected to at least one heat treatment or authorised treatment of equivalent effect by a milk processor and whose fat content has been brought to not more than 0.3 percent.
The original Six were in the process of implementing this legislation at the time of the accession of the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland in 1973. The fat levels in whole milk were gradually being established at 3.5 percent, and semi-skimmed in the range of 1.5-1.8 percent fat. The policy of the UK and Ireland prior to accession had always been that milk (other than skimmed milk) had to be sold "as from the cow" with no alteration of compositional quality whatsoever. As a safeguard, milk with a fat level of less than 3.0 percent could not be sold as liquid milk. Following accession, therefore, the Community added a fifth category of whole milk of "non-standardised whole milk" which was defined as:
milk with a fat content that has not been altered since the milking stage either by the addition or separation of milk fats or by mixing with milk the notional fat content of which has been altered. However, the fat content may not be less than 3.0 percent.
As the Commission saw it, the introduction of this additional type of whole milk gave rise to problems. Member states were first given the option of choice of definition of whole milk as either standardised or non-standardised. This led to the need to standardise whole-milk exports from a 'standardising' country to a non-standardising country up to the level of fat in the national milk supply in the non-standardising country. This level had to be defined and was easily policeable. It was, however, regarded as a barrier to the operation of a single European whole-milk market so the choice was removed and all member states have to allow standardised and non-standardised milk to be sold. Non-standardised milk can be and no doubt still is sold to consumers in the UK and Ireland, but large dairy companies are now selling standardised whole milk in the UK. The definition of non-standardised milk has effectively been made unpoliceable, and the quality of non-standardised milk sold
by a dairy is effectively left to the judgement of the consumer. With much whole milk now sold in the UK as standardised milk, consumers are now paying for milk at 3.5 percent what they previously paid for milk nearing 4.0 percent, the level of fat in the national milk supply. There is just no test that can be applied at market level to detect whether fat has been added or subtracted, and with half the market in the UK consisting of semi-skimmed sales it would no longer be possible to enforce the "as from the cow" system for whole milk by scrutinising the fat level of milk coming into and going out of a dairy.
The most serious problem with the price support policy has been that of controlling supplies, and the remaining policies to be described are concerned with this issue. Soon after UK membership, UK farmers' representatives urged their continental counterparts and Commission staff that a successful advertising and merchandising policy for milk and dairy products could go a long way to solving the problem of surplus. However, it was essential to success that there should and could be no "free riders" in such a policy - all had to contribute in all parts of the Community. This general stance was always greeted in some parts with scepticism. A common policy of selling effort did not seem practicable for the Community market as a whole, let alone for those member states that were also substantial exporters. Moreover, for the smallest producers in difficult regions, contributing to a selling/merchandising effort that appeared to have greatest benefit for expanding dairy farmers in
more prosperous areas at the top end of the scale never seemed an attractive or even reasonable policy. In May 1977 the Community did adopt Regulation (EEC) 1079/77 to establish "a co-responsibility levy and measures for expanding the markets in milk and milk products" and a levy was subsequently placed on deliveries to dairies (with exemptions for very small producers and those in difficult areas) of 0.5-1.5 percent to create a fund for market expansion measures. The policy was finally abandoned in March 1993. The levy created a substantial fund over the 16 years of its life (up to 700 million ECU per year at peak in 1984), but only a small part of the fund was used for the purposes of promotion and advertising on commercial markets. The Commission treated the fund as part of their "own resources" and the bulk of funds were spent on school milk and topping up schemes for disposal on which the Commission were in any case engaged. The initial ideas, therefore, have never been
tried on the scale necessary to have the required impact.
The other policy attack on surplus (avoiding, of course, the reduction of the support prices) is the adoption of schemes to persuade milk producers to move into alternative farming activities or out of farming altogether. Such policies might be thought of as the Community buying out the "contracted rights" that farmers believe themselves to have to a fair standard of living expressed in the aims of the Treaty. By targeting such schemes at the poorest and smallest groups it can be said that they have been aimed at correcting to a limited extent the deficiencies of a price support system in addition to relieving the surplus problem.
The earliest "non-marketing" and "herd conversion" schemes were introduced in 1969 and the initiative was introduced again in 1973 and 1977. The latter scheme ran between 1977 and 1981 and paid producers to withdraw from milk production for five years after which they were free to re-enter. Some farmers who had taken the premium under this scheme found themselves with no quota when they wished to come back into production after the contracted five years out. This led to a famous court case in which a Dutch producer (Mr J Mulder) sued the Dutch government in the European Court for disallowing him a quota. The producer won his case thereby allowing many hundreds of producers who had previously withdrawn to claim quota. In quota jargon this became known as SLOM quota (a Dutch acronym relating to this case). These schemes were not particularly successful in relieving the surplus problems. Even though they took out substantial numbers of dairy cows (especially in Germany -over
100 000 in the EU as a whole with 70 000 in Germany) they were the lowest-yielding cows and therefore the proportionate decline in deliveries of milk to dairies was much less than the reduction in cow numbers. As for the poverty problem, no detailed study has been made, but it can be said that the herds leaving were in most cases less than the average size in each member state, and in Germany the number of cows per successful applicant was less than half the average herd size in the country as a whole. It is a reasonable inference that the schemes went some way to removing from milk production some of the poorest milk producers and brought about a slightly improved structure in Germany.

VII. THE IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK OF THE EU MILK SUPPORT SYSTEM
The implementation of the EU milk support system is carried out by a complex web of the Community's main institutions together with national governments and their agencies, and producer-controlled and private commercial marketing organisations in each member state. Whilst in recent years there has been a tendency for the activities of farmer-controlled marketing organisations to become international, there has as yet been no tendency for their ownership or the membership to become international. Thus, for example, MD Foods, the largest Danish farmer-owned milk co-operative bought out the UK private milk business of Associated Dairies and Farm Stores, but the English milk producers supplying that business did not become part of the Danish co-operative. This is one of a number of similar instances. The Community support system remains nationally based with implementation of the farm price to producers dependent on national organisations and marketing structures, in addition,
of course, to the fact that the quotas that are part of the support system are nationally based.
Implementation starts each year with the Commission's proposals for support prices for the coming "campaign" year. The Commission's proposals are normally announced by the Commissioner for Agriculture as the starting point for the consultation process with the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee, etc., before the Commission places its formal proposals as Regulations before the Council of Ministers for enactment. The proposals for milk are part of the whole package of proposals for all other price-supported commodities, and other support measures, e.g., grant aids, are dealt with as part of the package. Reaching a settlement is often difficult and is the result of many bilateral inter-governmental (private!) discussions and open posturing in press briefings by ministers after Council meetings, etc. The political haggling and bargaining has often been such that with proposals usually made by the Commission in January, final agreement by the
Council has often not been achieved until June and sometimes even later. In such circumstances the marketing year has had to be extended by one to three months until Ministers or even heads of government, are able to agree a package in the decision-trading market.
The process of policy implementation revolves around the Commission because the Commission makes not only policy proposals to the Council but also detailed "rules Regulations" on its own account. Such Regulations are supposed to be in accordance with the opinion delivered by the Management Committee. Usually the preamble to a Commission Regulation will state whether or not the Management Committee has delivered an opinion within the time period laid down by the Commission chairman. It is, however, the Commission chairman who lays down the timetable, and negative outcomes can be avoided by the Chair. Clearly, the Commission is in a very powerful position in the implementation of policy. It can make detailed rules for the interpretation of Council Regulations and stipulate precisely how the agents in the system are to operate in delivering the policy. For example, the general rules for intervention on the market in butter and cream (Regulation (EEC) 985/68) are a Council
Regulation. This Regulation defines the product that may enter intervention (e.g., minimum fat content of 82 percent, maximum water content of 16 percent, made from sweet or sour cream); the intervention price is to apply to butter delivered to cold storage depots run by the intervention agency and so forth. The Commission Regulation (EEC) 685/69 (which has been modified with amendments several times in every year of its existence) lays down detailed rules, such as size of packages, types of packaging, dating, numbering, minimum quantities to be bought in one lot, sampling procedures, payment period to suppliers, temperature of storage and many other matters. The Commission, in other words, make most of the key management decisions in the running of intervention agencies for butter and cream and, as these are complicated products, decisions are extremely numerous. The same applies to skimmed milk powder: a Council Regulation lays down general rules (Regulation (EEC) 1014/68)
and a Commission Regulation ((EEC) 625/78) lays down detailed rules, and once again the changes and amendments over the years are numerous, although less so than for butter. Intervention agencies have to be inspected by the governments of member states, and reports made to the Commission which form part of the general informational flow to the Commission. There is a fine line in the making of detailed "rules Regulations" by the Commission for administration and implementation of policy, and the making of policy itself in the political process. By making detailed rules more or less tough the Commission is able to influence the effectiveness of the intervention prices laid down in Council Regulations. Thus, by tightening quality standards in times of surplus, rejection rates can be increased so that more rejected product has to come on to the market, influencing prices generally. Similarly, by lengthening the payment period, intervention is made less attractive and the
effective price to the producer forced down, especially in periods of high interest rates.
A similar situation exists regarding quotas ("reference quantities" in Community language). The introduction of quotas involved first a Council Regulation changing the basic Regulation (EEC) 804/68 (i.e.. Regulation (EEC) 856/84). This was followed by a Council Regulation laying down general rules, and then a Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the calculation of the super-levy that the system provides for. Management of the quota system at the national level by the Commission has been extremely tight, with detailed scrutiny of the statistics on which national reference quantities are based; the introduction of tight controls on the butterfat level of quota milk to prevent the addition of cream to raise the effective milk-equivalence of quota; and rules to prevent any dilution of the super-levy applied to individual producers when national guaranteed quantities and individual quotas are exceeded. An area of quota management that the Commission has not
entered in such detail, however, is the management of quotas by dairies (Formula B) or regions, in the case of individual quotas (Formula A). There are general rules for the adoption of the base period, which gave some flexibility, and for the treatment of special cases and the creation of "national reserves" to cope with them. But the system tied quota to "holdings" (i.e., loosely to land), and the rules provided for the transfer of holdings between producers by sale or purchase, inheritance or change of tenancy. This has been a difficult area within member states as it has substantial effects on property values, tenants' rights and rental payments, and comes up against the legal framework governing systems of property ownership in member states. (Article 222 of the Treaty states that it "shall in no way prejudice the rules in member states governing the system of property ownership".) It is not surprising that there are differences between member states in producers'
ability to transfer quota both temporarily and long-term, and therefore big differences in quota values and the value of the land to which it relates. All national legislation for the implementation of quotas has to be reported to the Commission to ensure that it conforms to the obligations in the Communities' general rules. This problem will be returned to at later stages of this study.
The Commission's part in the implementation of the support system is fulfilled by working with national governments in both the administration of the support prices and the quota system. Customs and Excise, for collection of import levies and tariffs and payment of export refunds, are an arm of national governments. National governments appoint the intervention agency and are responsible for ensuring that it applies the rules properly. National governments have been responsible for the implementation of quotas by ensuring that basic quotas were distributed in accordance with the rules; procedures were adopted for dealing with special cases; and the super-levy is correctly calculated and applied every year. They also in the first instance collected the co-responsibility levy when it applied. National governments, moreover, are responsible financially to the Commission for all of these activities, and are subject to the Community's Court of Auditors in doing so for monies
collected, claims against the Community's "own resources", and all monies due. Although the Commission is the central body and takes most of the key management decisions with all the pressure groups that are working round the process, the administrative machine itself is largely provided by national governments with a very small but powerful Commission staff involved centrally in what is effectively a management supervisory role.
In every country of the Community the great bulk of milk sold off farms (over 95 percent in most countries) is made by deliveries to dairies. It is therefore the activities of the dairies that at the end of the system finally deliver the milk price to the producers, the "targeted beneficiaries" of the system. Community policy for dairies is that they should be as competitive as possible in the single EU-wide market. Rationalisation and amalgamation has been encouraged by a policy of grants from Community Funds (principally under Regulation (EEC) 355/77 on common measures to improve the conditions under which agricultural products are processed and marketed). Amongst the criteria for support are that projects contribute to the objectives of Article 39.1 (a) of the Treaty and guarantee producers of the basic products a lasting and adequate share of the benefits. Nevertheless, the rules of competition, particularly Article 86 of the Treaty of Rome (the abuse of a dominant
position), apply to agricultural organisations. The application of this article, however, has been more a possibility than a reality. There are some very large dairy organisations in the Community, but they dominate regionally and there are still very large numbers of dairies in the wider Community market. It is in the smaller countries of Denmark (MD Foods), Sweden (Aria) and Finland (Valio) where single organisations have a dominating share of the market, but in each of these countries the large organisations appear to have remained competitive and have not so far been accused of "abuse" of their position.
There can be no doubt about the importance of producer co-operatives in the marketing of milk and the delivery of the support policy to the target beneficiaries. The proportion of milk deliveries from farms to cooperative dairies in various EU member states is set out in Table 1. In most countries except Italy the proportion is very high, whilst in France it is just 50 percent.

Table 1 does not give a market share figure for the UK as it was in a special position through the Milk Marketing Boards until 1993. The figure for the UK could be either zero or 100 percent depending on the view taken of the Boards as co-operatives. Most of the 23 co-operatives in the table are in Northern Ireland and they were in any case not paying dividends to member suppliers. (The issue of the new organisations from 1994 onwards and the demise of the Boards will be discussed in the chapter dealing with implementation in the UK.) In a survey of 21 countries by the International Dairy Federation, which covered 55 percent of the world's milk production and included all 15 countries now in the EU, 86 percent of deliveries to dairies were marketed by producer-controlled organisations (Empson [1990]).
It is clear, therefore, that producer co-operatives are one of the main agents in the policy delivery system. Their existence as a competitive force is important in assisting the flow of milk into and out of intervention products as markets fluctuate. It is convenient for the support system that the target beneficiaries are the main stakeholders in a substantial part of the PDS (policy delivery system) itself. In the event that the system is dominated in some part of the Community by private companies, it will rely heavily on price competition between purchasers to retain milk supplies when markets fall close to intervention milk price equivalent (IMPE) levels to ensure that there is no leakage of benefits. A highly concentrated, privately owned industry in which farmers have no alternative competing purchasers, or one in which there is collusion, may be able to force milk prices down below IMPE levels when market prices fall. The maintenance of competition for milk supplies
in the single market with free movement of dairy products is therefore crucial to the proper operation of the system.
Under the pressures of technological and structural change, continental cooperatives have become in a number of instances very large organisations, sometimes dominating regions in France and Germany and whole countries in Scandinavia. Such highly capitalised organisations, vertically integrated in the marketing chain, resemble in some respects a modern public company. Nevertheless, the nature of competition between cooperatives within the borders of those countries is different from that of private and public companies. The main purpose of a co-operative according to Parnell [1995] is to deliver a service to its primary "stakeholders". In the case of a dairy co-operative this is to market their milk although it might also include additional services. The principle purpose of a public company is to maximise profit or shareholder value. The business practice ("conduct" in the "structure-conduct-performance" paradigm) may not be all that different between the two types of
enterprise in so far as both have to seek to use capital and labour resources with maximum efficiency, especially when those resources are in a highly competitive mass market. Co-operatives compete to maximise the total return to their stakeholders, that is to say their milk price and the return on their capital. The calculation of actual returns on capital for a co-operative is a difficult issue because the stakeholders own the raw material. So the aim of co-operatives, even when required to show a nominal separate return on capital, is to maximise the milk price. This matter is quite different for private firms that purchase milk at the factory gate. To them milk, the raw material, is a cost, and a large one, that they must seek to minimise in order to maximise the return on shareholders' capital in the processing and marketing business. If a privately owned dairy is in competition with a local producer co-operative for milk supplies, it will have to be careful in sharing
the effects of any adverse market movements between its supplying producers and its shareholders for fear of loss of supplies, and hence its business, to the co-operative. In this situation, much can depend on the competing co-operative's rules of membership, itself a subject for scrutiny by the Commission in Brussels. Dairy cooperatives, that are well established in the marketing system are a powerful force affecting the general level of milk prices to producers, and they clearly have a strong incentive to maximise the efficiency with which they use their members' capital as well as the price they pay out to members for their milk. It would be meaningless to put a figure on any precise share of supplies that co-operatives should have to become an effective competitive force. This must depend on many locally variable circumstances of marketing and market structure. However, if the bulk of milk is handled and processed by private companies, their incentive to use the
intervention system in times of surplus might be relatively weak if by not doing so they were able to reduce the price of milk to producers. In these circumstances private capital in the industry may be able to "cream off some of the benefit intended by the regime for farmers.
In the language of contractarian economics, it might be said that cooperatives in the dairy sector avoid the largest of all "transaction costs" of a private firm, that of purchasing the raw material - milk. Dairy cooperatives in this sense extend the nature of the firm as described by R H Coase [1937]. In more recent theoretical work by Oliver Williamson [1974] on transactions cost economics, it has been demonstrated that the conditions that give rise to a high level of vertical integration in an industry with recurrent transactions are those where a high level of special-purpose ("idiosyncratic" in Williamson's terms) equipment is required at each stage of the processing and marketing chain. Such special-purpose equipment has a very low alternative-use and scrap value. These circumstances apply exactly in the processing and distribution of dairy products, and so it is not surprising to find that dairy co-operatives have grown into very large, vertically integrated
organisations. Their rules of membership, sometimes controversial and a very important part of their overall governance and local dominance, have often given the security of raw material supply necessary for the investment in specialist modern 'hi-tech' equipment, thereby enabling them to hold their own in a rapidly concentrating industry. Security of raw material supply other than by remaining price competitive is a difficult issue for private companies.
The point should also be made that ordinary commercial contracting for the sale of raw milk, which is effectively an intermediate product, is not an easy task. Produced daily and of high perishability, raw milk is a highly variable product and almost all of the elements of variability affect its commercial value. Milk production varies seasonally; it can be of highly variable bacterial and compositional quality, and can easily acquire unwanted residues - medicines or other. Taking account of these matters in contracts is costly, needing expensive testing facilities, and can give rise to disputes requiring settlement procedures. Research and greater understanding of the costs and control of these issues on the farm, together with modern automated laboratories is transforming the industry and has already done so in the last two to three decades; but handling these difficult matters in the form of commercial contracts has tended to favour integrated co-operative organisations
rather than private firms dependent on classical contracting in a market place. The co-operative membership can decide rules of payment for themselves, and handle matters relating to variability by fiat without reference to the market; they can also adapt such rules for themselves to meet changing circumstances when necessary. For a co-operative there is no slippage so far as benefits are concerned, and the rules regarding quality can be flexibly tailored to the actual products made and the markets being served.
The countries of Europe in which co-operatives have been less successful have been Italy, parts of France and the United Kingdom. In the UK the food processing and marketing industry has been heavily oriented towards imported supplies as a result of the country's historic free trade policy, leaving trade in liquid milk as the traditional market for the home producer. This undoubtedly favoured the growth of private and public companies and stifled the development of co-operative enterprise. The UK has, nevertheless, been heavily dependent on the political process for the establishment of a framework for concluding commercial contracts for the sale of raw milk, which in turn have depended on delicate procedural rules for arbitration. In France, in very recent years, the largest dairy organisation, Besnier, which is a private, family-owned company and easily the largest dairy company in Europe, has achieved huge growth, to the point where it controls more than 20 percent of all
French milk deliveries to dairies. This growth may have been assisted by the greater stability of milk supplies in a quota regime that takes out some of the key elements of variability from the contracting problem.
A final area of importance in the implementation of the European milk policy that undoubtedly affects policy delivery is the considerable extent to which some of the personnel of the industry's organisations become involved in the central processes of implementation. There are a number of inter-professional non-governmental industry discussion organisations, such as the farmers' unions through COPA, COGECA and the EDA, which have offices in Brussels and are in frequent discussions with Commission staff on the industry situation. The Commission has over the years been an open institution, and its handling of the more formal links for coordination with national governments has no doubt benefited considerably from its links with these functionally specialised bodies that represent private interests in the industry. The organisations in turn are able to act as channels for feeding back information quickly to their member marketing agencies or national unions to whom they must
react, and in some cases they smooth the path of executives through the Commission's open doors. Indeed, it might be said that the very high degree of industry involvement is one factor that has enabled a system of such enormous complexity to work with tolerable smoothness.
The implementation framework for the EU milk support system is summarised in Chart 3. The chart draws attention to the fact that the system of implementation is essentially "three tier". At the first level are the Community institutions that are involved in policy making and objective setting, as well as in the implementation process. At the second level are the institutions of national governments (15 of them) each having some flexibility, albeit limited, in operating the system. At the third level are the marketing agencies who are responsible for their own strategies in a competitive market, and are affected by the normal factors in a market Structure-Conduct-Performance relation of investment, economies of scale, product differentiation, advertising and brand loyalty, research and development, and consumer demand for dairy products.

VIII. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION AND CONDUCT OF POLICY
(A) The Implementation of Price Support
(B) The Implementation of Quotas
(A) The Implementation of Price Support
The Community's problem in fixing the level of support price in the milk sector is to fix the Target Price at a level that will be effective in supporting farm incomes but at the same time have regard to the related issues of budget costs and effects on markets and consumers. The price and income problem is compounded by the effects of output growth exceeding market growth, hence the surplus which the Community has had to reduce by quotas. In practical implementation of support prices by individual member states the Community has had to cope with market exchange rate instability throughout the whole period since Regulation 804/68 has been operative. Common prices are fixed by the Community in common currency units - UAs (agricultural units of account) until 1979 and ECUs (European Currency Units) since then. In the translation of UAs and ECUs into national currencies to operate the system, the Community, in conjunction with member states, has had to adopt a series of devices
to prevent fluctuations in market exchange rates from distorting internal Community trade flows and influencing the level of intended farm support. Nevertheless, with a large part of farm costs affected by market exchange rates and reflecting divergent inflation rates between member states, devices to stabilise output prices by insulating them from fluctuating market exchange rates must compromise the community's income objective for the sector to some extent, however vague that objective is.
The Community has always been politically sensitive to the issue of the effects on the margarine market of supporting the price of butter. High butter prices in the main household market clearly present a growth opportunity for margarine manufacturers. At the same time, subsidised disposal schemes for butter that target food processing and manufacture created difficulties for oleomargarine manufacturers. Raising the support price of butter inevitably raises the cost of such disposal schemes whilst improving the opportunities in the main household market for margarine.
One way round this dilemma would have been to tax the sales of margarine to prevent the leakage of benefits intended for dairy farmers, and to force margarine manufacturers to contribute to the cost of disposal schemes in the dairy sector. Even mild forms of this obvious proposal, such as imposing the co-responsibility levy on margarine manufacturers, which has been made from time to time, have given rise to an inevitable political storm. In some circles such ideas are branded as monstrous and an unspeakable interference with consumer choice. Increasing margarine consumption and falling butter consumption, so the argument runs, is a consumer choice made largely on health grounds and is little connected with the price of butter. Such arguments reflect the advertising campaigns of the oleomargarine manufacturers, and the extent to which they are believed throughout society reflects the huge financial resources behind them. The interest groups at work in this area have been
every bit as powerful as those of farmers. In recent years dealing with the dairy industry problems in this way would have been seen as attacking the established rights of the importers of vegetable fats and oils, and unacceptable within the framework of GATT.
The other arm of support for the milk price was also through a very weak market, that of skimmed milk powder. The effects of supporting the price of skimmed milk powder in the early stages of the common dairy policy was to increase production from less than 325 000 tonnes in 1960 to around two million tonnes by 1975, where it remained until quota control of the milk support and increases in other markets (particularly cheese) began to reduce it sharply from 1986 onwards. The huge increase in skimmed milk powder production between 1960 and 1975 occurred as a result of a decline in the use of liquid skim for stock feeding. A very large part of the disposal of skimmed milk powder (nearly 80 percent in the mid-1970s through to the mid-1980s) therefore took place as animal feed either for calf-feed replacers or pig feeds. Subsidies were high because skim milk powder is a relatively expensive source of protein and has to compete with other protein sources in the animal feed
market. Not surprisingly, subsidies on skimmed milk powder for animal feed have been a large cost in the Community budget for support of the dairy sector, especially after the mid-1970s when it became apparent that there was a serious disequilibrium in this sector.
Whilst there may have been some leakage of benefit here, calf rearing can be seen as partly a dairy business. In so far as it often takes place in specialist veal-producing units, such units need a supply of calves, and a strong demand for calves maintains the price of calves and dairy farms' income from that source. If the price of calves slumps, the price of milk needs to be higher to maintain farm income and vice versa.
The animal feed industry has been a strong growth industry with specialist and powerful commercial interests involved that have been fully capable of punching their political weight. Attempts by the Commission to enforce a policy of incorporating relatively expensively sourced protein in the form of skimmed milk powder into animal feed mixes was fiercely resented by the industry and in the end abandoned. Gradually, however, the degree of disequilibrium has been reduced as cuts in quota (in 1986 and 1987) and sharply increased utilisation of milk for cheese making have reduced the production of skimmed powder from its maximum of 2½ million tonnes in 1984 to just under 1 ¼ million tonnes by the mid-1990s. It remains a highly volatile market, however, subject to sharp fluctuations that can arise from the numerous sources that influence animal feed prices around the world.
What is clear from this description of the problems and development of the two markets on which support measures are concentrated is the extent to which those measures have influenced the structure of the processing industry and its markets. The enormous growth until the mid-1980s of skimmed milk powder production, and the development of the animal feed business around it, could not have taken place without the Community's support policy. The use of liquid skim on farms for animal feed has been reduced to very small proportions, with wide repercussions. The policy thus necessitated investment in the building of modem butter and skimmed powder manufacturing plants, which affected both co-operative and private businesses throughout the industry and hence the structure of the policy delivery system. Through the removal of skim from farms, it has influenced the structure of farming, enabling dairy farms to become more specialised, with, for example, the establishment of
specialist business units raising calves for veal production, which has influenced the trade in calves.
The IMPE price is supposed to represent 90 percent of the Target Price for 3.7 percent fat milk fixed by the Council. To establish it as a figure, two essential practical pieces of information are needed for which the Commission has, at times during the period of the policy, been reliant on the industry. These factors are the costs of manufacture of a tonne of butter and a tonne of skimmed milk powder (or a "processing margin"), and the product yield factors, i.e., the number of tonnes of milk (at 3.7 percent fat) to a tonne of butter (at 82 percent fat) and the number of tonnes of skim milk to produce a tonne of powder.
Whilst the costs have been carefully established on agreed accounting conventions, they have not been kept up-to-date in recent years, and are subject to a large amount of assumption and conjecture. Such areas in the implementation of policy can and do become battle grounds, and in recent years it is an area of dispute in which the industry has tended to retire from the field. The erstwhile ASSILEC (now EDA), which was responsible through its Costings Committee for supplying information, no longer undertakes the task. The model of the working of the system for 1994/95 is set out in Table 2 below.
The processing margins in Table 2 are "model" calculations with some historic grounding in fact. It has to be emphasised, however, that even if they were completely up-to-date there is no guarantee of the availability of the IMPE to all producers throughout the Community; costs vary from factory to factory, as do standards of rejection by intervention agencies, and variations in payment period can affect the effectiveness of the intervention prices themselves. The system is one of general market support and relies on the competitive marketing agencies to deliver a price to farmers at or close to the Target Price.

Attention has already been drawn to the fact that the ratio of fat to solids-not-fat elements in the support system detailed in Table 2 has changed over the years, with a higher proportion of the support progressively coming from skimmed milk powder. This has been determined by budget cost as much as by the market. While some of the loss of the butter market could have been avoided by reducing the price of butter and raising that of skim powder, the budget cost of this at a time when the milk sector took up more than one-third of the FEOGA budget made it prohibitive. Steps could be taken to change the ratio only when the world market prices for support products were favourable or when the Target Price was reduced by reducing the price of butter rather than of skim powder. Budget ceilings and world market conditions have had an impact on the practical implementation of the support policy, although the Community is such a big player on the very small world market that its
surplus disposal cannot but affect the world market however much the Commission seeks in its conduct to act passively. The small size of the world market results from the conduct of policy by most of the world's major milk producing and consuming nations who isolate their producers and consumers from the volatile nature of world dairy product markets. (New Zealand, with its grass-based dairy economy, is the only leading milk-producing nation not to do this, and is heavily dependent on exporting although in global terms it represents a small part of world milk production.)
Institutional prices in the EC fixed in ECUs have to be translated into national currencies in the member states in order to operate the system, and it is at this stage that some of the biggest differences in practical implementation have arisen. This is another feature that has made the dairy policy "national" to a high degree, notwithstanding the involvement of the Commission in the details of running the support mechanisms. From the mid-1980s, alterations in "green rates of exchange", particularly devaluations of green rates, were decided each year as part of the Price Review package, and became one of the bargaining chips. As an illustration of the large differences that have arisen in producer prices, the end point of the system, Table 3 shows the prices in Germany and the UK in two years, 1992 and 1993. In those two years there was a difference of over 15 percent in producer prices between the two countries. Part of this difference (as will be shown later) arises
through the market system, but it is compounded by some 5-6 percentage points as a result of differences in green and market rates of exchange in these two years.
The operation of the agri-monetary system has been changed over time, although its effects have not been removed. Until the completion of the Single Market programme, monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs) were calculated every week and imposed as levies or subsidies at borders to represent the difference between green rates of exchange (decided by the Council) and the market rate. The Single Market rendered MCAs an inappropriate device, and the "switchover coefficient" was invented to replace it. The switchover coefficient was used to realign the ECU green rates in order to prevent revaluations of currencies from lowering prices in national currencies and devaluations from raising them. Institutional prices thus remained stable in national currencies by changing green rates to make them so. This system was changed again after difficult negotiations in February 1995 by revaluing all green rates by 20.75 percent and raising institutional prices to match. It was intended to
leave institutional prices in national currencies unchanged and so remove the threat to farm prices, particularly German, of the need to revalue the green rate for the DM and benefit producers in countries with weak currencies immediately in the event of devaluations in their market rates of exchange.

The conduct of policy by national governments on green currency negotiations has demonstrated greater differences in attitude towards farm support than almost any other issue. With the exception of the UK, countries with weak currencies (which includes the UK, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain) have been prepared to devalue green rates to raise farm prices. The UK has always argued that to do so adds to inflation, and has been prepared in some periods to accept very large differences between green and market rates. Countries with strong currencies (the Deutschmark bloc - Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands) have often fought hard against revaluations that would reduce prices to their farmers.
The total FEOGA budget expenditure on the milk sector in 1995 was 4.3 billion ECU and may be a little lower in 1996 at 4.2 billion ECU. A breakdown of appropriations for 1994 between the various market support activities is set out in Table 4, which shows that the largest expenditure is on export refunds.

The system of subsidies for the disposal of intervention products is implemented by a series of Commission Regulations issued each year on an on-going basis. For example, the subsidy rates for the sale of butter to "non-profit-making institutions" is fixed by a Commission Regulation, as are subsidies on butter and butteroil for the bakery sector, ice-cream manufacture and concentrated butter, and claims are approved and settled through national intervention agencies. Subsidies on the sale of skim powder for animal-feed use, and re-constituting and liquid skim, are fixed similarly by Commission Regulation. Intervention sales for animal feed are also tendered for and the terms are again fixed by Commission Regulations.
Analysis of FEOGA Budget expenditure can be made by country according to the various subsidy schemes, which enables a reasonably precise picture to be built up of where exactly expenditure goes. An analysis of this is set out in Table 5 for expenditure in 1993. This analysis emphasises the importance in the budget of export refunds, and shows that those countries exporting milk products outside the Community, particularly the Netherlands and Denmark, are responsible for a high proportion of expenditure, especially when compared to their proportion of deliveries of milk to dairies in the Community. However, some caution is necessary. Because the Netherlands is an exporting country, all of the export refunds administered through the Dutch Produktschap do not apply 100 percent to Dutch produce (see Ch IX), but partly to products from other parts of the Community moving through Dutch agencies and ports. Similar reasoning can apply to some other areas of support. For skimmed milk
powder, for example, (not butter) intervention agencies can take the produce of countries other than their own; this could also affect the conclusions to be drawn from an analysis of Table 5. Nevertheless, the general point can be sustained that a relatively high proportion of budget expenditure goes to countries with high exports out of the Community.
(B) The Implementation of Quotas
The European Union instituted its quota regime with legislation at the eleventh hour on 31st March 1984. There was indeed much political opposition within the agricultural industry and in the Council of Ministers (Petit et al. [1987]). In the two Regulations themselves. Regulation (EEC) 856/84 which made the necessary changes to 804/68 and Regulation (EEC) 857/84, the word "quota" does not appear. Regulation (EEC) 856/84 cows' milk...." when "guaranteed total quantities" of milk in each member introduces "... an additional levy payable by producers or purchasers of state are exceeded. Regulation (EEC) 857/84 then enacted "... general rules for the application of the levy". The system was to apply immediately (as has already been noted in Section V) for five years starting on 2nd April 1984 - "as a matter of overwhelming public interest". (Preamble.)

The introduction of this legislation, and its tone and manner, marks a drastic change of emphasis in Community thinking about the conduct of the CAP. Respect is still paid, as indeed it has to be, to the aims of the Treaty Establishing the European Community in Article 39. "The.... structural surpluses as a result of an imbalance between supply and demand... are imposing financial burdens and market difficulties which are jeopardising the very future of the common agricultural policy." (Preamble 856/84). The Preamble then goes on to state:
"... a careful examination of the different possible ways of re-establishing balance in the milk sector shows that, despite the administrative difficulties which its implementation may involve, the most effective method and the one having the least drastic effect on the incomes of milk producers is the introduction... of an additional levy on quantities of milk delivered beyond a guaranteed threshold."
The statements in the Preamble to this legislation are the most clear-cut up to that date that the aims of agricultural policy could not impose unacceptable financial burdens. At that stage the milk sector was taking more than one-third of the FEOGA Guidance sector of the budget; butter and skim powder intervention stocks had reached record levels and threatened to go higher; and world markets reflected the Community's difficulties. The Community, either through the Commission or the Council, did not then and has not since attempted to define what "reestablishing balance in the milk sector" means. It has not meant in practice that supply should be brought into line with internal demand, which, given the different imbalance in butterfat and solids-not-fat on the market, would be very difficult. Nor has it been defined in terms of an upper limit on acceptable expenditure on subsidies and disposal measures, influenced as they are by world markets. Nor yet is policy linked to
any degree of self-sufficiency. All of these are uneasy grey areas with different interests and member states having their own agenda forming a difficult basis for achieving commonality.
One objective the policy was intended to achieve was that:
"the measures taken to cope with the increase in milk deliveries should not prevent structural changes which are required;"
To achieve this there has been considerable flexibility in the conduct of the system that gives rise to diversity.
To keep the immense detail of the conduct of quota policy within reasonable bounds each of the following main elements will be discussed in turn: (i) the base period; (ii) the use of Formula A and B; (iii) the distribution of quota to individual farmers; (iv) deliveries and direct-sales quotas; (v) the short-term transfer of quotas and leasing; and (vi) the land link and long-term transfer of quotas. It is in the quota policy in general and those elements in particular that, more than for any other policy, detailed conduct is in the hands of national governments, requiring national legislation to operate it, and so leading to different treatment between member states.
(i) The base period for total guaranteed quantities The total quantity to be guaranteed in the first year (1984/85) was the total deliveries to dairies in the calendar year 1981 plus 1 percent, i.e., 98.2 million tonnes. The additional 1 percent was "to allow for transition to the new system" and was removed in year two reducing the total guaranteed quantity to 97.2 million tonnes. In the tough negotiations in the Council that took place, Ireland (invoking the Luxembourg Convention) declared milk to be a vital national interest, arguing that "the dairy industry contributed directly or indirectly to about 9 percent of the gross national product, a proportion materially higher than the Community average;" (Preamble 856/84). Italy also argued that "in 1981 the collection of milk production was the lowest of the last ten years... the apparent increase in deliveries between 1981 and 1983 corresponds in large part to a structural change consisting of a reduction in direct (sales
and) ... an increase in deliveries to dairies"; (Preamble 856/84). On the basis of these arguments, exceptions were made for Ireland and Italy and their reference quantities were fixed on the basis of deliveries to dairies in 1983, which was the first important difference in implementation between countries.
Because of the treatment of the Republic of Ireland it was argued (see Thatcher [1993] p.337) that the province of Northern Ireland should be treated similarly, and so the United Kingdom was given an additional 65 000 tonnes from the Community reserve (created to deal with Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK) for the benefit of Northern Ireland.
(ii) Formula A and B The general "rules Regulation" gave member states the option of two administrative formulae for operating the levy and managing the reference quantities distributed to individual producers. Under Formula A, the national reference quantity would be distributed to individual producers and the individual producer would be responsible for paying a levy of 75 percent of the Target Price on sales above the quota. Under Formula B, a levy of 100 percent was imposed on a dairy when the total reference quantities of its supplying producers was exceeded by their deliveries. The dairy in this case was responsible for paying the levy and collecting it from its supplying producers. Formula B had the advantage that if some producers did not fulfil their quota, those who over-supplied did not pay a levy until the quota of those who under-supplied had been used up.
The use of the two formulae did give rise to differences of treatment, and the rules were changed over the years to bring the two systems gradually into line in terms of their effect on individual farmers. Regional off-setting of "over and unders" was allowed under Formula A, and the levy rate changed to 100 percent (in 1987). Off-setting between regions (Formula A) and then between dairies (Formula B) was allowed, and the levy rate was then increased to 115 percent of the Target Price (1990). The effect of these moves was to make the management of reference quantities gradually a national matter.
(iii) The distribution of quota to individual farmers In order to allow flexibility, individual quotas, distributed directly or through dairies, could be based on sales in 1981, 1982 or 1983, but could not exceed the total national guaranteed quantity of 1981 plus 1 percent (857/84 Art. 2). Member states could create a reserve for handling special cases, and could retain part of such a reserve for handling contingencies. In handling claims from special cases, Germany and the Netherlands over-allocated and as a consequence had to adjust. In the UK all producers in the first year (1984/85) were given an initial quota of 1983 sales minus 9 percent (because of the increase in sales between 1981 and 1983). Nearly half of all producers appealed, and were invited to do so against a number of criteria according to whether they had development plans (with or without government grant) or whether special circumstances had affected their deliveries in 1983. Cases were heard by regional
committees appointed for the purpose by the Ministry of Agriculture with powers granted by Parliament. Many farmers with development programmes on which money had been borrowed for capital investment did not get all the quota they needed and were hard hit throughout most member states, and there was undoubtedly some rough justice through the application of equal rules to everyone.
(iv) Deliveries to Dairies and Direct Sales Quotas The levy on sales above the quota for deliveries to dairies was also to apply to milk sold directly by farmers to consumers, or the milk equivalent when the direct sales were of dairy products. The quota fixed for direct sales was sales in 1981 plus 1 percent for producers selling by this method. Producers who sell milk both by deliveries to dairies and directly to the public have two quotas, one for each type of sale. It has to be said that this is probably the most difficult of all areas to handle administratively, and opens up the possibility of almost uncloseable loopholes, which has led to unequal treatment both within and between countries. In Belgium and Italy comparatively high levels of milk are sold in this way, and as a consequence those countries have had direct sales quotas (DSQs) that have been as much as 12 ½ percent of their deliveries quota. For producers with two quotas it is impossible to prevent
transference from one type of quota to another. (This is recognised in Article 6 of 857/84 and the revisions to it.) While transference cannot sensibly be prevented at the individual farm business level, it has not proved possible to prevent it at the national level either; legal provision has had to be made accordingly (Commission Regulation (EEC) 2033/85 with numerous revisions).
(v) Short-term transfer of quota and leasing Formula B (the dairies quota) provided from the start a mechanism for short-term transfer of quota within each year. Modification to Formula A (individual farm quota) provided similar benefits regionally under this method of applying the additional levy. Further modification to both Formula A and B enabled regions and dairies to offset over-fulfilment and under-fulfilment in calculating levy liability that made the additional levy a national calculation.
Therefore a producer producing over quota in any year in a member state is in a risky situation. He will not know until the end of the year whether or not he will be subject to levy (at a rate since 1st April 1990 of 115 percent of the Target Price, which is well above the farm-gate price received by the vast majority of producers throughout the Community). Given the problems of calculating off-sets between dairies and regions, and the necessity to leave open national deliveries quota until producers with both DSQ and deliveries quota have made their decisions and their effect has worked through, it can be some time after the end of a year before a producer who is over quota will know whether he has a levy liability or not.
The management of quota is down to member states, and there can be no doubt that the degree of risk to which farmers are subject in managing their own quotas has varied a great deal between member states. Producers are dependent on the quality of information systems to inform them, especially in the closing months of the year, whether their dairy, region or country is likely to be over quota or not.
Some member states have introduced a leasing scheme for the temporary transference of individual quotas (the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland and the UK are examples) which has effectively meant the setting up of a market for temporary quota transfer. The Commission legalised these arrangements (Commission Regulation (EEC) 1546/84 Article 8) albeit after their development had already started in some member states. The Commission has tried to standardise to some degree the way such a short-term transfer market should work by specifying how long the leasing market should remain open within the year. This has been a controversial matter as clearly the price of a leased quota is going to be affected by the assessed risk of being in a levy-paying situation as the year progresses. In some years the requirement has been for the market to be closed by the end of July, in some by the end of September, and in others by the end of December. The leasing market has tended to grow in the
countries that have had such schemes. Quota leasing rose in the Netherlands from 1.1 percent of deliveries quota in 1989/90, its first year, to 4.3 percent in 1993/94. In the UK it was 1.2 percent of quota in 1986/87, the year of introduction, and 6.2 percent in 1993/94 (Bulletin No. 309 of the International Dairy Federation (IDF) 1996).
(vi) Long-term transfer and the land link The Council's initial legislation seemed to tie quotas to land. Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) 857 read as follows:
"Where a holding is sold, leased or transferred by inheritance, all or part of the corresponding reference quantity shall be transferred to the purchaser, tenant or heir according to procedures to be determined".
Gradually varying degrees of flexibility have become established through the interpretation of "a holding" of land on the one hand, and the words "all or part of the corresponding reference quantity" on the other. There have nonetheless been wide differences between member states in interpretation and degrees of flexibility allowed in the national systems of permanent transfer of quotas. Member states are authorised to place a "quota tax" on transfers if they wish to provide a national reserve for restructuring programmes or assistance to young farmers in getting established. (Germany, for example, has such a scheme, while the UK does not maintain a national reserve). The UK has had considerable difficulty with regard to transfers in cases of tenancy. Landlords claimed ownership of the quota; tenants argued that they had expanded milk output on the farm as a result of capital input and herd improvement. The matter had to be resolved by formula, giving landlords a basic 70
percent and varying the proportion according to tenant improvement (or otherwise) of the business, but allowing tenants 100 percent rights in purchased quota.
In some countries a maximum amount of quota transfer has been stipulated per hectare of land transferred. In the Netherlands, permanent transfer of 20 000 kg of quota requires the transfer of a minimum of 1 hectare of land; the land cannot be transferred back within the year of quota transfer or in the year following. In Germany, the rules have been much stricter. To begin with, land and quota could only be transferred proportionately to the original quota allocation to the holding when a part transfer was made up to a maximum of 5 000 kg per hectare. This was raised to 12 000 kg per hectare in 1990/91 - still much more restrictive than the Dutch level. In the UK fixed links between quota and land have not been adopted with the result that land has been transferred with quota in one year and re-transferred without quota in the following year.
The most developed quota transfer markets have become established, not surprisingly perhaps, in the Netherlands and the UK. Quota prices in the Netherlands are believed to be the highest anywhere in the Community, reaching levels of four times the milk price compared with two to two and a half times the milk price in the UK. The efficiency of Dutch milk production is well known and doubtless important in raising the quota price in relation to the milk price. However, a very important fiscal difference exists between the two countries: Dutch farmers are allowed to write off the cost of quota purchase against tax liability over five years; in the UK, quota purchase is treated for taxation purposes as expenditure on non-depreciating capital. In the Netherlands, there is therefore on UK principles a "government contribution" towards purchasing quota that obviously affects the level of prices and may well be the principal reason for the big difference between the two countries.
Denmark has gone out of its way to prevent the establishment of high capital values for quota. On 1st April 1984 Denmark established a new Danish Milk Board which was to perform two major functions: to buy all milk from all producers to re-sell to dairies; and to administer quotas as a single dairy for the whole of Denmark. It re-sells milk to the dairies to which producers are already affiliated without interfering with the local terms. The Board is a legal sole purchaser and is responsible for the super-levy. It has to keep producers informed throughout the year, allocate unused quota, and collect any levy due from those responsible if the national quota is exceeded. A producer is allowed a maximum of 10 percent over his quota in the distribution of unused quota in any year, after which super-levy will be collected when national quota is exceeded. The money is collected from milk payments in May and June.
Denmark has a national re-allocation scheme for long-term quotas, as far as possible operated through the Milk Board. Quota is bought up from producers wishing to leave milk production and re-sold to continuing producers at a price fixed politically - D.Kr 1.25 per kg. Demand exceeds supply, and the maximum quantity that a producer may purchase is 9 percent of his existing quota in any one year. Quotas can also be transferred with land in Denmark. A maximum of 10 000 kg of quota may be sold or leased with one hectare of land, and no land may be sold at all at a later date if this figure is exceeded. Politically there is a consensus in Denmark that capitalisation of quotas should be avoided as far as possible. Most parties would like to see the quota system abolished in the long run, a move that will be more difficult the more heavily capitalised are quotas. (H.H. Sørensen in Bulletin No. 309 of the IDF. 1996.)
It is clear from this general survey of the conduct of the milk quota policy in the EU that there is a great deal of variation between member states, some of which at least arises in response to local problems. Member states are required to report every step in the process of implementation to the Commission, and when approved these reports frequently result in amendments to the Council Regulation (EEC) 857/84 and in the Commission's detailed rules Regulation (EEC) 1546/88. Both these Regulations have been amended frequently at a rate of two, three and sometimes four times a year. The Commission has, nevertheless, been taken to task by the Court of Auditors (Official Journal, C12.Vol.37,1.5.1.94) for failure to respond quickly enough to national legislation and for failure to enforce sufficient uniformity to enable a reasonable move of the present system away from its national base to a full communautaire system.
The Court of Auditors have also argued that although quotas have brought about an improvement in the imbalance of supply and demand in the EU, which was their purpose, an imbalance still exists which could be further corrected if the Commission applied the rules for temporary transfer much more toughly. The Court suggested that temporary transfer, which gives a free allowance everywhere to exceed quota, should not be allowed; temporary transfer should, according to the Court, take place only when there is a leasing scheme in operation (pp.cit. para 4.50). The Court argues that this would reduce deliveries to dairies; improve producers' planning of production; and make the implementation across member states more uniform. The Commission have so far rejected this approach, arguing that it would inhibit structural development and preferring to improve the overall imbalance by small and gradual reductions in national reference quantities.

IX. PRACTICAL CONDUCT IN THREE MEMBER STATES
Italy
The United Kingdom
The Netherlands
So far, this study has focused attention on the implementation of the general model of support in the EU milk sector, i.e., the model of Chart 2 in which the milk price to farmers is under-pinned within Community borders by support buying of butter and skimmed powder and externally by a system of variable levies and export refunds (now "tariffised"). The budget cost and market imbalance consequent upon this system in an enlarged community has had to be limited since 1984 by the implementation of quotas. The different attitudes of the bureaucracies of member states to quotas have given rise to much variation. This chapter considers three countries in more detail: in two, Italy and the UK, variations in the "model" have been politically necessary to cope with the fact that the policy delivery system (PDS), particularly at the third tier in Chart 3, is different from the rest of the EU and is influenced by the unique market structures in those countries; in the third, the
Netherlands, the PDS is affected by the broad historic orientation of both farming and the government towards trade.
Italy
(a) Market Structure
Very little milk in Italy is used for butter making and Italy has never made significant quantities of skim powder. The largest usage of both whole and skimmed milk in Italy is for cheese making. Italy is a milk-deficit country overall, consuming more milk and milk products than it produces. In terms of total butterfat, Italy has an overall self-sufficiency coefficient of 71 percent, and in terms of solids-not-fat, of 67 percent in 1993, these ratios not having shifted much over the years. This means that Italy is one of the largest milk-deficit areas in the Community. Of the intra-Community trade in liquid milk, more than half is accounted for by Italian imports (EC Dairy Facts and Figures 1994 Table 90 p.146). With a major part of this coming from Bavaria, Italy is a significant market for German milk producers. Italian imports of cheese (the majority from other EU countries) are also very substantial at around 290 000 tonnes in 1995, a level that is exceeded only by
German imports from other EU states.
The cheese industry in Italy is unique. More than half of the available milk supply (including imports) is manufactured into cheese. Excluding milk imports, more than 60 percent of indigenously produced milk delivered to dairies is used for cheese making. The significance of this figure lies in the fact that 80 percent of cheese manufacture is of varieties that are exclusive to the localities from which they come and that cannot therefore be made outside those areas. This applies, for example, to the two largest varieties, Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano. These two cheeses utilised 39 percent of manufacturing milk in 1995. Italy has at least a dozen other varieties of cheese that are exclusive to their areas of origin.
In Community terms, the Italian dairy industry with its annual production of around 9 ½ million tonnes is less than half the size of the French or German, comparable to the Dutch (around 10 ½ million tonnes), and smaller than the British (which is about 14 million tonnes). The Italian industry is, however, very much concentrated in the northern provinces of Lombardy, Piedmont, Veneto and Emilia Romagna which account for over 70 percent of Italian cows' milk output and two-thirds of the cow population. Yield per cow in Italy at 4 840 kg in 1993 is somewhat below the EU average of 5 147 kg, but above the levels of other Mediterranean countries. Yields are rising, as in all member states, as dairy cow numbers decline. The main Italian cheeses of Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano are made in regions within the main milk-producing provinces. The Italian dairy industry is thinly spread in the rest of the country with very small cow herds, a high level of direct farm sales and
very small processing units.
Italian cheese consumption is one of the highest in the EU (20.1 kg per head in 1993), second only to France (22.8 kg per head in 1993) and growing. Consumption of liquid milk (75 kg per head in 1993) is below the EU average (84 kg per head), and is tending to fall slowly, as it is in other EU countries. About half of Italian liquid milk consumption is of UHT milk (a growing proportion) and more than 40 percent is semi-skimmed. Butter consumption in Italy is very low relative to the rest of the EU.
From the point of view of implementing Community policies, Italy has a difficult processing industry structure because it is extremely fragmented. In the Commission Report by Dr J Gay on the "Structure of the Dairy Industry in the European Community", Italy is shown to have 2 430 dairy "enterprises" in 1991 compared with 296 in Germany and 966 in France. More than half of the milk deliveries are to enterprises handling less than 20 000 tonnes of milk in a year, a much higher proportion than in other countries with a major dairy industry. Fragmentation is particularly evident in Dr Gay's survey in the Italian cheese industry, with almost 70 percent of Italian cheese output being produced by enterprises producing less than 4 000 tonnes a year. In almost all other member states, over 70 percent of cheese production is in enterprises producing more than 4 000 tonnes annually. The liquid milk and fresh products enterprises in the 1991 survey are also shown to be relatively small,
although there are fewer of them (327) and a larger proportion of output is in the hands of larger enterprises than is the case for cheese. It is fair to say that the structure of the cheese industry in particular and the large (though rapidly declining) element of direct farm sales make the job of establishing the accurate statistics throughout the system that policy implementation relies on especially difficult for the Italian authorities.
The supplies and disappearance pattern of the Italian cheese market is also important in understanding the implementation of Community policy as it has features that differ from cheese markets elsewhere. Table 6 gives the supplies and disappearance for 1993.
Stock levels tend to be high in relation to production not because of surplus but because much Italian cheese is of hard varieties that are very long maturing. Ripening is therefore an important element in the production process and also in production costs. Both imports and exports of cheese are high and have grown substantially since the establishment of the common market in the milk sector. Imports in 1970 amounted to 93000 tonnes, compared with 292 000 tonnes in 1995. Exports in 1970 were 23 000 tonnes and 121 000 tonnes in 1995.

(b) Conduct of Price Support
With Italy's unique market and milk utilisation structure, the Community's policy of support for the butter and skimmed powder markets did not have great relevance when the system was designed in the 1960s. Prior to 1968 the Italian dairy industry had received some support through the liquid market. Municipal dairies were given exclusive rights of sale within regions and provinces at politically controlled prices. In the establishment of Regulation (EEC) 804/68 the Community abolished all local liquid milk market support arrangements of this type (which also existed in Germany -Article 22.2) in favour of a common system. The difficulty in Italy was its market structure.
In order to free the liquid market the Community decided to cover the principal Italian cheeses of Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano by support price arrangements (804/68 Article 8) as the best means of providing general support for the milk price to producers throughout Italy and fulfilling the general aim of 804/68 of ensuring that producers to the south of the Alps had the same chance of obtaining the Target Price on "the aggregate of milk sales". Accordingly, the Council of Ministers has fixed intervention prices each year for Grana Padano both at 30-60 days and at 6 months, and for Parmigiano Reggiano at 6 months, at the same times as fixing a Target Price for all milk and intervention prices for butter and skimmed powder.
Details of conversion factors (milk to products) and processing margins used by the Commission (along the lines of Table 2 for butter and skimmed powder in Chapter VIII) are not available for Grana Padano cheese. The intervention price for Grana Padano at 30-60 days has been fixed in recent years at between 757 and 869 ECU per 100 kg, well above the intervention prices for butter and skimmed milk powder. Intervention prices for Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano at six months are both considerably higher (an additional 91 ECUs per 100 kg for Grana Padano and almost 140 ECUs per 100 kg for Parmigiano Reggiano). These amounts would presumably allow for shrinkages during ripening and other storage costs, and the size of the differences in support prices at one or two months and six months indicates that these are very important elements of cost.
In practice there has been very little use of intervention for Italian cheese because market prices have usually been well above intervention levels. The industry has, however, had the benefit of Private Storage Aid (PSA), known in Italy as a "ripening subsidy", paid on Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses and in more recent years also on Provolone and Pecorino Romano cheeses. For Grana Padano a daily rate applies for cheese of at least nine months old put into store for between 90 and 180 days. For Parmigiano Reggiano a daily rate also applies, but the cheese must be at least 15 months old and stored for 90 to 365 days (Council Regulation (EEC) 972/68). Since 1991/92 the Commission has reduced the daily rates from 2.91 and 3.09 ECU per tonne for Grana Padano and Parmigiano Reggiano respectively to 1.45 and 1.55 ECU per tonne currently. As this is a relatively important part of Community budgetary expenditure for the milk sector in Italy, it has probably contributed
to a reduction of producer prices in ECU terms from 1993 compared with earlier years.
Exports of cheese, as have been shown, are of importance to the cheese industry in Italy. Just over one-third of exports go outside the Community and the rest to other Community countries. These figures may be affected by the fact that exports to other Community countries are sometimes for export outside the EU when the export refunds in those countries are paid more quickly than in Italy. Either way, export refunds and cheese prices in other parts of the EU are important to Italy, and the general milk price is to dairy farmers.
In July 1994 the Council of Ministers decided to abolish the intervention system for Italian cheeses but to continue efforts to stabilise the market through Private Storage Aid for such cheeses (Council Regulation (EC) 1880/94). Quota controls on milk output will limit to some extent the production of most cheeses, and market prices are high because of strong demand. The need for intervention has therefore virtually lapsed. The Italian government has over the years allowed the weakness of the Lira to be felt in the green ECU/Lira exchange rate, even before the new monetary arrangements in January 1995. This has tended to increase product prices in Italy even when Community institutional prices have been stable or reduced. The attitude of the Italian authorities on this matter reflects the country's very large milk deficit: there is every point in discouraging demand and encouraging local milk supply by passing on to both consumers of milk products and producers of milk the
Community's institutional prices through a reduction in green rates as market exchange rates weaken.
Italy has had by far the highest producer prices in the Community as a result of the unique circumstances described. As a rough guide, if 4 percent is added to the ex farm price for 3.7 percent fat milk shown in the Eurostat tables, it will approximate to a delivered dairy price and can be taken as a percentage of the Target Price. (Co-responsibility levy would make little difference in Italy as the vast majority of small farms were exempt.) In the early 1990s (and before) the Italian price was around 130 percent of the Target Price, about 20 percent more than the Danish price, which is the next highest, and almost 40 percent above the Irish. In 1993 the Italian price in ECU terms fell and again in 1995. It has been affected by the reduction in PSAs (Private Storage Aids) in 1992, the abolition of the special intervention system for Italian cheeses in July 1994, and the realignment of intervention prices and the value of the ECU in all currencies at the beginning of 1995.
Despite all this, the devaluations of the Lira against the ECU in each year between 1993 and 1996 have been such that the Italian producer price in national currency has increased each year.

(c) Conduct of Quota Policy
Italy did not apply reference quantities at the beginning of the quota policy in 1984/85 as required by the general rules Regulation (EEC) 857/84. After an exchange of correspondence between the Italian government and the Commission in 1984 and early 1985, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion under Article 169 in March 1985 and the matter was submitted to the Court in December 1985. The Court judgement (Case 394/85 - Report of cases before the Court pp 2741-2754) issued in June 1987 argued that failure to comply with obligations under Community law could not be justified by circumstances in a member state. While deliveries to dairies appeared not to exceed deliveries quota and direct sales were falling during the first four years of the policy, the Court argued that meeting objectives by alternative means could not justify non-compliance, and found in favour of the Commission. Subsequently, quota cuts (in 1987/88 and 1988/89) applied to Italy, as elsewhere, meant that
Italian deliveries to dairies did exceed deliveries quota in 1988/89. The Italian authorities, however, were still unable to distribute individual reference quantities to producers to ensure that the additional levy was collected from those who exceeded their quotas. The monies due nationally were paid by reduction in the clearance system from payments due for export refunds and storage subsidies through EIMA (the Italian intervention agency) and the Finance Department. By 1992 (eight years after the EU had instituted the policy) the Italian authorities had still not distributed individual reference quantities to producers although the legal framework for doing so had been created by December of that year. This framework required UNALAT (the association of producer groups representing the majority of milk producers) to collect the levies from producers and manage quotas, but no individual reference quantities had been fixed by the organisation. An assessment of the situation
in 1991 had shown that Italy appeared to be in excess of its national guaranteed quantity by 2½ million tonnes and the budget cost of this had soared.
The Italian authorities argued that the very large excess quantity that appeared to be being produced by 1991 and 1992 was not due to an increasing gap between demand and supply since the beginning of the quota policy, but to the weakness of their national statistics which had seriously understated the national quota to which Italy would have been entitled in the beginning. By 1992, it was impossible to impose a national quota for distribution that was as defective as it appeared without considerable destructive effect, particularly as the industry had undergone considerable structural change in the previous eight years.
In December 1992 the Council of Ministers agreed to consider an increase in the total guaranteed quantity for Italy in order to permit the system to operate quickly with effect from 1st April 1993. The Italian law of December 1992 had created the framework for establishing individual quotas. Producers belonging to producer groups would be treated slightly differently from producers who did not. The former were given quota in two parts, A and B. The A Quota was to correspond with sales in 1988/89 and the B Quota was to correspond with the amount by which quantities marketed in 1991/92 exceeded those in 1988/89. Non-members of producer groups may have quota allocated to them according to quantities marketed in 1988/89, which must not exceed quantities marketed in either 1990/91 or 1991/92. Reference quantities were allocated subject to a decision of the Council regarding Italy's guaranteed total quantity. National measures were to be introduced through EIMA to buy up quota
through a voluntary discontinuation programme to find part of the milk required for B quotas. For non-members of groups, purchasers were required to draw up lists with declarations of the quotas of their individual suppliers based on 1988/89 if these were not in excess of either 1990/91 or 1991/92.
The Council of Ministers in July 1994 agreed an increase in the national guaranteed quantity allocated to Italy for 1993/94 of 0.9 million tonnes, subject to proper implementation of the quota scheme. The figure of 0.9 million tonnes included a reserve of 347 701 tonnes for allocation to the many producers who would have been entitled to reference quantities in the base period, but had subsequently given up production and then taken proceedings against the Italian government and obtained judgement in their favour. Such cases were to be agreed with the Commission for reserve allocation (Regulation No., 1883/94 Article 1). Implementation was to provide an independent framework for maintaining the system, which would establish individual reference quantities to include individual references for butterfat, and set up a central agency to verify production records and collect levies from producers. From the 1995/96 marketing year the total sum of individual reference quantities
has to correspond to the national guaranteed quantity set by the Council for Italy.
There were further delays in the settlement of individual quotas for producers in Italy, principally because of the very large numbers of appeals against allocations. With the agreement of the Council, the administrative procedure for dealing with appeals was vetted by the departments of the Commission. Out of 110415 producers to whom quota was allocated, there were 40 843 appeals, of which 24 030 were found to have reasonable prima facie justification. Some producers obtained judgements in their favour through legal proceedings in cases where grant-aided expansion plans were in progress and quota allocation inadequate.
Quotas for direct sales were allocated on the same basis as deliveries quota. Italy has agreed a large number of requests for transfer from direct sales quota to deliveries quota, as allowed under the Community rules. The Commission accordingly authorised the adjustment of national quotas in March 1995 by transference of 420 000 tonnes form direct to deliveries quota.
The allocation of individual reference quantities at the end of March 1995 to 110415 producers was as follows:
A Quota
B Quota
Total
National Quota
000 tonnes
Deliveries
Direct Sales
Totals
Note: The above is taken from Commission document COM (95) 147 final which has also been used in the description of this section.
Deliveries and direct sales in 1993/94 and 1994/95 fell below the national quota figures so in these years there was no application of the additional levy. Italy exceeded its national guaranteed quantity for the first time with the system in full operation in 1995/96. Some 15 000 producers are in a levy-paying situation and by mid-1997 around 8 000 producers are said to have paid, leaving 7 000 who are refusing, with civil disturbances reported in the media.
The United Kingdom
(a) Market Structure
The UK's unique market and dairy industry structure results from a history that was quite unlike anything elsewhere in the Community at the time of Accession in 1973. In the early 1970s more than 60 percent of the UK's relatively large milk output from farms was used for the liquid market, with the product sold to consumers "as from the cow" (i.e., with natural fat content and "unstandardised"), very little sale of skim as drinking milk, and no sales of reduced-fat milks. A high proportion of the UK's substantial requirements of dairy products was imported, especially butter (90 percent) and cheese. These imports were particularly important in the very narrow "world market", especially to New Zealand, with whom the UK had a special understanding regarding milk policy, but also to Ireland, Denmark, Australia and other countries. The record of understanding on milk policy between the UK and New Zealand governments in the 1960s could be regarded as New Zealand's contracted
right to supply the British market. For a very long period, imports of dairy products were allowed freely into the UK and prices to consumers were consequently low. In response to requests from New Zealand and Denmark as traditional suppliers, and complaints by them against "dumping" on the butter market, the UK government introduced limited control on imports in 1962 but not such as to raise prices substantially. Trade in liquid milk was impossible by virtue of sanitary regulations requiring all premises used for pasteurising and packaging liquid milk for sale to UK consumers to be licensed by a local authority who was responsible for hygiene standards. Double pasteurisation was not permitted, and drinking milk had to be pasteurised and packaged (mostly in bottles) in the same premises. Foreign supplies were therefore excluded from the UK liquid market either as bulk milk or packaged milk. While dairy product prices to consumers were low, prices of liquid milk tended to be
higher even though they were politically controlled and subsidised for long periods after World War II and before entry into the then EEC in 1973.
Consumption of liquid milk and butter were both high by international standards and the markets were therefore large. Apart from controlling the retail liquid price the government also subsidised the market through a welfare scheme for expectant mothers and children under five years (one pint a day at half price) and a school milk scheme for all school children.
The structure of the dairy industry itself in the UK differed from that of continental Europe in so far as it was dominated by large private and public companies with scarcely any farmer-co-operative enterprises except in Northern Ireland (although consumer co-operatives were strong). The large dairy companies and consumer co-operatives were nearly all involved in a doorstep delivery service for bottled milk, usually by running their own rounds services, and in some parts of the country also selling bottled milk to "bottled milk buyers", who ran small private delivery businesses but were not large enough to run capital-intensive pasteurising and bottling plants efficiently. Sales of milk through shops was very small.
Dairy product manufacture in the UK was a relatively small industry. Large companies made a complete range of dairy products in addition to distributing liquid milk. Priority of manufacture would usually be given to cream when there was a range of products, then cheese, mainly cheddar but also a range of hard, pressed "territorial" varieties. Butter manufacture was very much a residual usage of milk. With the bulk of milk all the year round going to the liquid market, dairy product manufacture tended to be seasonal and fluctuating. As a result it has a history of being relatively high cost, which, together with very low market prices, meant that milk prices to producers for the main products of butter and cheese were very low.
Following the great depression of 1929 and the early 1930s, the UK government enacted the Agriculture Marketing Acts of 1931 and 1932. These Acts enabled farmers' representatives to establish statutory approved Milk Marketing Schemes to constitute Milk Boards that would have the exclusive right to market all milk produced in an area, provided the Scheme received the approval at a poll of a two-thirds majority of all producers in the area producing at least two-thirds of the milk. Five Boards were established in the UK under this legislation, one for England and Wales (in 1933), three in Scotland (one main Board plus two independent small ones for Aberdeen and District and the North of Scotland in 1934) and one for Northern Ireland (in 1955). Detailed histories of the activities of the Boards from different perspectives can be found in Baker [1973], Strauss [1972] and Empson [1996].
The most essential features of the Milk Marketing Boards in the UK were that they controlled all milk sold off farms in their areas; they negotiated terms of sale of all milk to buyers in their areas; and the prices at which they sold milk to the dairy trade varied according to the usage of the milk by the company. The highest price was charged for liquid milk, with a range of prices for manufactured products varying from cream at the top to butter and skim powder at the bottom. The receipts from all sales were "pooled" with the average pooled price being paid to farmers. Thus the Milk Marketing Boards were non-governmental, farmer-owned and farmer-controlled, but derived their power and authority from Parliamentary statute. Their constitutions and rules of governance in the form of the Milk Marketing Schemes had to be approved by Parliament. Throughout most of their history the UK government maintained close control over key prices in the system, including liquid wholesale
selling prices of the Boards and the retail price by the dairy trade from the beginning of World War II. Farmers were given a guaranteed price which was limited after 1954 to a "standard quantity" loosely related to liquid sales. Trade margins were controlled by elaborate costings systems, and the guaranteed price was related to income objectives for agriculture as a whole through negotiations between the government and the National Farmers' Union. The system was elaborate but completely dependent on the Boards as the policy delivery agents.
(b) Implementation of Community Price Policy
The implementation of the Community's price policy for milk clearly presented difficulties in the UK given the very low prices of dairy products, the position of New Zealand in the butter market, and the position of the Milk Marketing Boards which appeared to run counter to the whole thinking behind Regulation (EEC) 804/68.
The Treaty of Accession provided for the free movement of goods in the enlarged Community from the date of accession (1st January 1973) and established formulae for the gradual alignment of prices over a transitional period of five years. Free movement was to be achieved by "accession compensatory amounts" on products imported into the UK from other member states. These were subsidies to importers (and taxes on exporters) to bridge the gap between prices in the UK and the rest of the Community which would be reduced in steps as intervention prices in the UK were aligned to full Community levels in January 1978. At the same time, the guaranteed price in the UK was raised each year by the milk equivalent of the alignment of intervention prices, and the system was phased out by the beginning of 1978.
New Zealand was dealt with by means of Protocol 18 attached to the Treaty. Maximum quantities of butter and cheese were allowed in under this Protocol for each of the calendar years 1973 to 1977. Special levies were to be applied to these imports into the UK and the products allowed in were not to become the subject of intra-Community trade or of re-export to third countries. The sales of the New Zealand butter and cheese were therefore confined to the UK market and not part of the Community market as a whole. The agreement in Protocol 18 was extended for New Zealand in 1978, 1981, 1984, 1989 and 1992, the size of the quota being reduced on each occasion with concessions on the size of the levy for reduced quantities. (Details of quantities can be found in EC Dairy Facts and Figures, 1994 Edition pp 143-144.)
The sharp rise in butter prices in the UK resulting from Community membership has greatly reduced the size of the market from 500 000 tonnes in 1973 to around 180000 tonnes now. At the height of the Community's butter mountain problem in the mid-1980s, butter stocks in the UK exceeded 320000 tonnes, almost 15 months' consumption. Two publications of the Milk Marketing Board ([1977] and [1987]) give a detailed account of the development of the market, and the operation and cost of the Community's support and stock disposal programmes. At the same time, UK milk output was stimulated by the relaxation of the UK government's deliberate policy of restraint on milk production in the 1950s and 1960s, and dairy farmers' expectations of their business prospects within the EC. With liquid sales falling slightly, butter production in the UK increased to over 200 000 tonnes by the mid-1980s which, together with New Zealand quota (which had been cut to 78 000 tonnes by 1985), meant that
total available supply of butter in the UK was much greater than consumption. This market situation was undoubtedly a major factor leading to the quota policy, and also to the UK government's support for it. The most difficult problem for the Community at the start of UK membership was the Milk Marketing Boards. As we have seen, UK policy had supported the farm price (although at a low level) through political control of the liquid market with the Boards as the principal agents in the policy delivery system. Such support systems had been specifically legislated out of existence by the Community in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands as part of 804/68. The problem in the UK was different, essentially because it was on an altogether different scale, and it was important that the UK liquid market should not be damaged. It was regarded as very complex in the negotiations for British entry to the Community with the result that the matter was shelved by a Declaration of
Understanding attached to the Treaty of Accession by both sides. Clearly these declarations were not intended to have legal force, and left the problem unsolved. (Treaty concerning the Accession ... (1972) pp 122-124.)
Fearing that leaving the matter unresolved after the end of the transitional period might lead to a challenge to the Boards in the European Court, the Commission produced draft proposals for legislation at the end of 1977 amending Regulation 804/68 to accommodate the special position of the UK Boards and "laying down general rules" for their operation to bring them specifically within the Community framework, albeit an altered one. The matter was hard fought in the Council and in the discussions surrounding it, with some member states who hoped for an improved market situation for their exports to the UK striving to reduce any advantage they thought the Boards gave to UK milk producers.
In June 1978 the Council adopted Regulation (EEC) 1421/78 which legalised the Boards' exclusive right to purchase milk within an area and the right to "equalise the prices paid to producers" subject to certain conditions. The main conditions were:
1) that such bodies may be authorised if they represent at least 80 percent of producers who produce at least 50 percent of the milk in their area;
2) that in the member state concerned the proportion of milk used for direct human consumption when compared to the total quantity used in all forms was at least 150 percent of the same proportion averaged over the Community as a whole;
3) per capita consumption of milk for direct consumption had to be greater than the Community average;
4) the producer organisations themselves had to operate within the rules to be laid down which would ensure that the principles of the Treaty regarding free movement of goods were maintained, that competition was not affected "more than is absolutely necessary" and that intervention arrangements were not interfered with.
These were tough conditions to be written into the general rules, but, as a Regulation changing 804/68, Regulation (EEC) 1421/78 presents in its Preamble another shift by the Council in the conduct of policy for the milk sector. The Council state in the Preamble that there are "other mechanisms for attaining" the objectives of Article 39 of the founding Treaty which for "reason of the high cost to the Community of the... intervention system... appear (s) appropriate...". There can be no doubt that this statement in June 1978 represented a big modification in thinking about policy, particularly when considered against the fact that the original version of 804/68 specifically legislated against policies in other member states that were now being provided for the United Kingdom. It was the first legislation to specify "the high cost... of the intervention system..."
The negotiation of the general rules and conditions which became Council Regulation (EEC) 1422/78 and the detailed rules Commission Regulation (EEC) 1565/79, was undoubtedly a messy political process. Many groups with an interest beat a path to the Commission's open door: several succeeded in their mission and enforced changes in the operation of the
Milk Marketing Boards that weakened them and led to their eventual demise in 1994. Since the story has already been told by the present author in previous publications (Williams [1986] and Williams [1993]), suffice it to say here that Regulation 1422/78 exacerbated the difficulties of contracting to sell milk between the Boards and the dairy trade to the point where it became almost impossible within the legislative framework provided, and a fresh start became necessary. The fresh start meant in fact sweeping away a number of the accumulated rights that the dairy trade in particular had succeeded in establishing in the old system to the detriment of the main intended beneficiaries of the Community's support system.
The Milk Marketing Schemes in the UK were revoked by government legislation in 1993, and the Boards were invited to put forward a scheme of re-organisation for approval by the Minister that took "account of the interests of the purchasers of milk". Once again this was legislation under duress. The UK government and the Boards were fighting cases in the European Court that if lost "would force change" upon the industry, according to the then Minister of Agriculture, Mr John Gummer, "not in an orderly way but by damaging and random impact" (quoted in Williams [1993]). The Boards responded with schemes to turn themselves into voluntary co-operatives. However, in order to take account of the interests of the dairy trade, as required by legislation, the government insisted that the main Boards should divest themselves of their commercial businesses and form co-operatives selling only farmers' raw milk. The Board in England and Wales ran the National Milk Records service and large
breeding, veterinary and advisory services which the government ordered it to set up as separate businesses. The England and Wales Board's commercial enterprise, Dairy Crest, was the largest dairy company in the country and has now become a public company listed on the Stock Exchange. All dairy farmers were given shares in the public company according to their sales to the Board in its final year, 1992/93, but to raise further equity and repay the revolving fund used to finance the business, one-third of its shares were sold to institutional investors prior to flotation. The farmers therefore lost once again the opportunity of forming a system that would parallel that of continental Europe through the establishment of a large, producer-controlled, all-through marketing co-operative.
Milk Marque was successfully launched, and two-thirds of deliveries to dairies in England and Wales are sold through this organisation. But private companies are constantly seeking to persuade producers to contract directly with them for the promise of a contract based on "Milk Marque plus" price terms. Clearly such a system is not stable and would be put under strain in the event of the Community disbanding or substantially relaxing its quota controls on production after the year 2000. It is a question for serious consideration whether the whole Community system of support would not be undermined after the year 2000 if quota controls are lifted and there is no farmer stakeholding in the market system in the UK.
The marketing system in the UK has not at any time since accession delivered a particularly favourable price to British producers vis-a-vis other member states, and the reasons for this in the Board era have been the subject of debate (see Pitts, Haines and Jenkins [1987] and Williams [1987]). Indeed, notwithstanding the Community's support arrangements, particularly since the mid-1980s returns to the England and Wales Board for manufactured milk were as low as 74 percent of the Target Price (Williams [1993] and Milk Marketing Board [1992]). The overall returns to producers in the 'New World' of 1995 and 1996 have shown some improvement, but it has been small and has still left prices to producers in the UK at a similar level to Ireland and well below Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and France, despite the favourable price of liquid milk.
Community expenditure for the conduct of support arrangements in the milk sector in the UK is not amongst the highest relative to the level of milk deliveries to dairies (see Table 5). In the case of the UK, however, even more than of Italy, this may be very misleading. With half the UK's deliveries to dairies going to the liquid market, the Community's expenditure goes on the half that is manufactured, on export refunds, and aided support for butter, particularly Private Storage Aid. The major part of UK exports, particularly of butter but also of cheese, go to other Community countries and much of this is probably re-exported thereby enhancing export refund costs from those member states. The heavy costs of support for manufactured dairy products and the inefficiency of the processing industry in the UK became disguised in the Community budget and partially disguised also in the average price paid to producers through high returns from the liquid market. Neither the 'New
World'/post-Board marketing structure nor competition policy at UK or EC level seems to have made much impression on this situation.
Whilst it is not proposed to enter into the details of contracting to sell milk by the new predominant organisation 'Milk Marque' (these are discussed in Williams [1993] and set out in detail in Milk Marque [1993]), it can be noted that the UK situation illustrates the considerable difficulties there are in contracting to sell raw milk from farms. The system in place has already given rise to considerable controversy (see House of Commons Agriculture Committee, Session 1995-96 pp xliii-lxiv). Milk Marque contracts are based on "service" as the main area of variability and market value in UK circumstances. However, milk is sold by Milk Marque (as it was by the Milk Marketing Boards) entirely by volume even though payments to farmers vary according to butterfat and protein levels, total cell counts and somatic cell counts. So the system encourages high quality in these respects from farmers, but does not attempt to reflect it closely in the market returns from individual
buyers. It is fair to say that, while the present system is controversial, the "transaction cost" and the contracting difficulties of a system that took account of all the elements of variability with a market value would be even more difficult and controversial. Nevertheless, the system of selling through a co-operative based on service contracts, although sanctioned within EC law, is not primarily based on the main pillars of the support system for butterfat and solids-not-fat in the Community. All the evidence is that the constituents of milk have low value, and are therefore not handled efficiently by the processing industry in the UK. Moreover, the service basis of Milk Marque's contracting to sell milk has, since its inception, come under increasing strain and is weakened the more milk has to be sold on "spot" contract terms.
(c) The Conduct of Quota Policy
The United Kingdom implemented the Community's quota policy (as has already been discussed in Ch. VIII Section B) in a fairly orthodox way. Details and analysis of effects have appeared in a number of publications and it is not proposed to provide much further detail here. (See for example MMB [1989] and Ch. 3, 4, 7 and 8 in Alison Burrell Ed. [1989].) The preferred political choice for solving the surplus problem by the UK government and even some sections of the farming community would have been to reduce the support price rather than implement a quota system. But it was accepted from the beginning of discussions that this was not an option, and the UK government were fully prepared to ensure that, once agreed, a quota system would be applied vigorously. The immediate announcement of a base of "1983 calendar year wholesale deliveries minus 9 percent" was a tremendous shock to dairy farmers. The Community base of 1981 had been a very poor year for British dairy farmers with
the west of England (the main milk producing area) hit by a freak snow storm in April 1981. Although 1983 was chosen for structural reasons to allocate individual reference quantities, the cut-back had to be particularly harsh because of the special circumstances that applied to 1981.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the number of appeals in the UK for special treatment was high. Some 23 000 producers in England and Wales applied for additional quota as "special cases", which amounted to almost 60 percent of the 3 8 900 producers registered with the England and Wales Board at the time. British priority in the debate about quotas was not concern for its farming interest, but to ensure that the policy was put in place brought budget spending on the CAP under control. With milk at the time being the largest item, and Britain a net contributor, controlling budget expenditure, which milk quotas would certainly do, was considered paramount for ensuring that a larger share of the Community budget went on non-agricultural spending. If obtaining agreement of the French government to a quota policy meant giving way on the base period, then so be it. (UK aims regarding overall Community budget policy are discussed in Margaret Thatcher [1993 p.62].)
The UK government quickly introduced in May 1984 an "outgoers' scheme" under Article 4 of Regulations 857/84. It offered 13p per litre, payable in equal instalments over 5 years, to small producers (initially those with less than 200 000 litres) to give up milk production for at least as long as a quota scheme or any successor scheme lasted. Expenditure on the scheme was limited and less generous than schemes introduced in other Community countries which bought a larger share of national quota for redistribution. (Details are tabulated across countries in International Dairy Federation Bulletin No. 245 (1989) Table 2 p.20.) With only a small initial allocation of quotas released in the UK by the initial outgoers' scheme, and so part of the applications for treatment as special cases either denied or scaled down, the rapid development of a market in quotas is not surprising. The price of quota quickly increased, and reached more than twice the milk price especially after the
Community cuts in quota in 1986 and 1987.
Large numbers of producers had difficulty in the early years in keeping their milk output within 5 percent over or under quota [MMB 1989]. After a sizeable under-shoot of national quota in the first year, each subsequent year has resulted in a small super-levy payment until 1994/95 and 1995/96. By the third year of the policy (1986/87), the UK had a leasing scheme in operation that gradually gained in usage. In the first year of operation, 195 million litres in England and Wales (1.5 percent of total deliveries quota) was leased. This figure grew to 880 million litres or 7.9 percent of deliveries quota in 1993/94. Through the Milk Boards, the UK also had a good information system almost ready made, and did not have to set up a purpose-built one as did the Danes (see Ch. VIII).
In April 1994 the Intervention Board took over the management of quotas. With the demise of the Milk Boards and the UK using Formula B, dairy farmers found themselves facing 80 or so registered quota holders. The fine tuning of "over and unders" that had been possible with the Milk Boards because all dairy farmers received information about their own exact position as well as accurate estimates of the national position with their monthly milk cheque, supplemented by weekly information conveyed through the press and on-line computer systems, suddenly changed. It became much more difficult to obtain a complete and accurate picture. In 1994/95 and in 1995/96 the UK made record super-levy payments to the Community of over £44 million in both years, representing a substantial loss to dairy farmers, and the country, because the information that the Milk Boards had made freely available at minimal cost was no longer provided.
Leasing schemes have continued and the amount of quota leased rose from 880 million litres in 1993/94 to 1 040 million litres in 1994/95 and 1 143 million litres in 1995/96, according to the Intervention Board's figures. Producers leaving the industry are allowed under the rules to lease their quotas to other producers, regardless of the dairies being supplied. No data are available on the short-term movement of quota between different parts of the country.
Finally there is the problem of long-term transfers of quota. The restrictions imposed in the UK on long-term transfers of quota with land have been less than anywhere else in the Community. In consequence, since the introduction of quotas producer numbers have continued to go down and those that remain in production have been getting larger. The system of selling quota runs through specialist agents and land agents, advertising in the farming press and offering a complete service of negotiation and arrangement of transactions. Each year long-term transfers have been at a level of between one-third and one-half of the amount of quota leased. In 1994/95, for example, 562 million litres were sold compared with 1 038 million litres leased; in 1995/96, the figures were 600 million litres and 1 143 million litres. Leasing can sometimes be a half-way house for producers who are running down in preparation for leaving milk production.
Quota prices and leasing prices are variable and in some years volatile. Generally sale prices for long-term transfer have been increasing over the years. In 1984/85 prices of around 10p per litre were common; by 1986 this advanced to 12-14p per litre and by spring 1987 it reached 30p per litre. In the last few years prices have been as high as 70-80p in February/March to drop back again to 45-50p per litre in April/May. Leasing prices in most years have been in a range of 5-7p per litre. In the last year or so once again prices have fluctuated wildly but are probably averaging around 12p per litre.
Sales of quota and leasing are privately run schemes, but regulated. Until 1994 the information system was privately run by the Milk Boards and, on the evidence, well done. Since April 1994 the job has been taken into the public sector and run by civil servants; it is clear that large sums of money have been wasted. With a British government ideologically committed to the privatisation of the implementation of services that had been publicly provided, the taking back into the public domain of an essential servicing element in the system, with disastrous consequences, is a strange reversal of direction.
The Netherlands
(a) Market Structure
The most distinguishing feature of the market structure of the Dutch dairy economy is that it is export and trade orientated. The butterfat self-sufficiency ratio was 229 percent in 1993, indicating that Holland exports more than twice as much butterfat as it consumes. This ratio, which has varied little in the last decade or so, has not been reduced by the quota policy. The comparable ratio for solids-not-fat, on the other hand, was 101 percent in 1993, had been about 80 percent in a number of years during the previous decade. The main reason for the differences in these two ratios lies in the fact that Holland is the EU's largest importer of skimmed powder, which it takes mostly from other Community countries. Substantial quantities of skim powder imports are re-exported outside the Community, but substantial quantities are re-constituted and used for animal feed, particularly calf feed for the calf export trade in which Italy is the largest market. The Netherlands does
not have a large beef industry, and a high proportion of its calf crop is used for veal for export.
Dutch milk production is also heavily dependent on trade. Deliveries to dairies are about 10 ½ million tonnes from a dairy cow population of about 1¾ million cows that is steadily decreasing as yield per cow rises. Stocking density is nevertheless exceedingly high, with heavy fertiliser use. Milk yield per cow in the Netherlands is one of Europe's highest, and is heavily dependent on concentrate feeding to highly bred dairy cows. Herd size structure is good compared with other member states, the majority of family dairy farms (60 percent) having herds of 30-100 cows. (National Dairy Council [1996] Table 143 p.214.)
Since the Netherlands produces very little cereals, its milk output depends on a high import content in compound feed mixes. Manioc imported from south-east Asia has been an important source of cheap, imported energy supplies in concentrate feed. It requires specialised handling facilities that are available in Dutch ports and so the Netherlands was not much affected by the world cereals and protein crises in the 1970s. Dutch milk producers benefited greatly from the common dairy policy during the 1960s and 1970s. Their prices rose initially to bring them into line with the rest of the Community and they were less affected than other countries by the rise in costs in the 1970s. The 1960s and 1970s were therefore prosperous years for Dutch dairy farming, and the growth of deliveries to dairies between 1968 and 1983 was, not surprisingly, faster than any other Community country.
At all levels the structure of the Dutch dairy industry is geared to international trade. Just under two-thirds of milk deliveries to dairies are used for butter and cheese manufacture. Butter production is just under 150000 tonnes (much of it made from fat released from milk in the manufacture of other products), but imports are also substantial, especially from other EU countries (126 839 tonnes in 1993), and exports at 258 000 tonnes are well above production. It is convenient for other EU countries to export butter through the Netherlands where export refunds are paid much more quickly than elsewhere. Cheese production is around 650 000 tonnes and, with imports of around 75 000 tonnes from other EU countries, total exports are around 465 000 tonnes. As with butter, a large part of Dutch production is exported but other member states' exports are passing through Dutch ports. The Netherlands also produces substantial quantities of condensed milk and whole milk powder,
using about 13 percent of the country's whole milk supply for these two products. Once again, however, both products are imported and exports represent a very large part of production. Exports of whole milk powder have been particularly important in recent years, and exports of condensed milk have been historically important in the Dutch traditional trade links with south-east Asia.
Consumption per head of liquid milk (in all forms) is around the EU average but tending to fall (84 kg per head in 1993). Cheese consumption is slightly below the EU average (15.8 kg in 1993 against an EU average of 17.4 kg). Consumption of butter is low at 3.3 kg per head in 1993, while consumption of margarine at 12.0 kg per head is one of the highest in Europe.
According to the 1991 structural survey of Dr J Gay (already referred to) there were only 22 enterprises handling milk and producing dairy products in the Netherlands, and this number may have been reduced by 5 or 6 since. Most of these enterprises are co-operatives that take about 90 percent of the milk deliveries from farms. The three biggest enterprises, Friesland Dairy Foods, Campina Melkunie and Coberco, are large cooperatives who together handled 80 percent of all milk processed in 1995 and are deeply into the marketing chain as manufacturers and exporters of milk products. An outstanding feature of Dutch dairy enterprises is their size. The average size of enterprises producing liquid milk products, butter and cheese is all very much greater than most of their rivals in other member states. It is reasonable to suppose that, as the great bulk of output of butter and cheese is in the largest factories, the Dutch dairy industry makes more efficient use of both labour and
capital resources in the manufacture and marketing of dairy products, and achieves greater overall economies of size than is achieved by dairy product manufacturers in any other member state of the EU.
(b) Conduct of Price Support
The implementation of policy at national level in the Netherlands is divided between two principal agents, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Productschap voor Zuivel. The Ministry of Agriculture runs the Intervention Bureau and has overall responsibility for ensuring that the system as a whole is implemented according to Community Regulations. Decisions on the sale of butter from intervention through the Community disposal schemes are taken by the Ministry, which supervises the acceptance of product into intervention and the payment of Private Storage Aid for butter and cream. (The Dutch dairy industry makes good use of the storage aid for cream over the spring peak.)
The Productschap, which is a semi-public body, is responsible for administration of policy in the area of trade (under Ministry supervision). Certificates are issued to exporters verifying the product and the amounts that have been traded and compliance with GATT rules. When the certificates have been granted, payment of refunds is made within 3 weeks and claimed against the Community's "own resources". The system is quick and efficient and results in payments to exporters that would take as many months through the Customs and Excise departments in their own member states. The Productschap also administers the school milk scheme in Holland and is responsible for the calculation and collection of the super-levy in close co-operation with the private and co-operative dairies.
It has already been pointed out that about one-quarter of the budget cost of the EU dairy support policy is actually incurred in the Netherlands. It is, however, totally misleading to infer from this that the expenditure is all on Dutch dairy products. A considerable part of what appear to be Dutch exports of butter and cheese to non-Community destinations originates in other member states. Exports of whole and semi-skimmed milk powder, for example, outside the Community are considerably greater than Dutch production. Normal published trade-flow tables are inadequate for estimating the EU expenditure on support for indigenously produced Dutch dairy products, and the effort is not worthwhile. It is clear enough that the returns to dairy farmers in the Netherlands are heavily dependent on the Community system of support as a whole. Much Dutch produce is exported to other member states and is therefore dependent on the prices of dairy products and the operation of the support
system in those states. At the same time, it might also be said that the efficiency of the Dutch export system itself would appear to lend support to producers in other countries where some leakage in the efficiency of the operation of agents in the system appears to take place. The secret of Dutch efficiency is the close co-operation between the Ministry, the Productschap and the marketing organisations. The rules are applied flexibly and practicably with less bureaucracy than in a large government department acting alone.
The Netherlands has been part of the Deutschmark group of countries and, as one of Europe's strong currencies, the Dutch guilder has not had problems of devaluation. On the contrary, the Dutch have had the problem of how to avoid situations in which revaluation would lower support prices in the national currency. The strong and stable Dutch guilder has not, however, posed a serious problem for Dutch dairy farmers.
The policy delivery system as a whole might be said to work at its best in the Netherlands. The efficiency of the agencies implementing EU policy, combined with the efficiency of the operation of Dutch dairy co-operatives and the highly competitive nature of the rest of the dairy trade, come together to deliver to dairy farmers a milk price that has been very close to the Community's Target Price for 3.7 percent fat milk. There have been variations over the years, but they have not been large. There is also some variation between the prices paid by dairies, but the high level of competition has kept these relatively small. Price data is published and fully available to the industry. Such differences as exist may be due to many factors over which management has varying degrees of control. Among the three big co-operatives, Friesland Dairy Foods pays the highest price, with Campina Melkunie and Coberco slightly lower. The Friesland price may be related to its cheese production
and exporting position, but the advantage is not great and in some years Melkunie and Coberco have achieved the best price.
(c) Conduct of Quota Policy
The quota policy in the Netherlands was applied in an orthodox way. Formula A was chosen initially and individual reference quantities were based on sales in 1983. Producers with development plans and special circumstances in the base period were able to appeal against initial allocations, and in handling these appeals the Dutch authorities over-allocated 1 to 1 ½ percent in individual quotas more than their national guaranteed quantity for the first two years. This situation was corrected by three generous national outgoers' schemes that targeted small producers initially, those producing a maximum of 250 000 kg in a year, and then older producers, first those over 55 years' old and then those over 50 years'.
The Netherlands changed from the use of Formula A to Formula B at the beginning of the 1988/89 milk year, which meant that the dairies became collectively responsible for the management of the quotas of their supplying producers. The management of quota nationally was done by the Productschap through a committee of representatives of dairies that coordinates information across the country. Even so, the payments of super-levy by the Dutch dairy farmers seem to be quite high in recent years. Information available for the period 1989/90 to 1993/94 indicated the following sums of money paid each year:
Million Guilders
These sums indicate amounts in excess of quota nationally of 0.8 and 0.7 percent, except in 1993/94 which amounted to 0.3 percent. This is a modestly good record, but less so than Denmark's and the UK's before 1994/95. Quota management nationally with Formula B is more difficult when there are a number of dairies, many of which want more milk in any case to keep their plant running close to capacity and meet market demand. Small dairies can be well under quota, even when quota is being exceeded nationally.
The Netherlands introduced a leasing scheme for the first time in 1989/90, and leasing quickly rose from 1.1 percent of total national quota in the first year to 4.3 percent by 1993/94. The amount of quota leased each year is greater than the amount that is permanently transferred, and there is a relatively free market in each type of transaction as there is in the UK. With permanent transfer there is a land link in the Regulations, but it is honoured more in the spirit than the letter which means that quota transfer is more or less a free market. Leasing transactions were twice as great in 1993/94 as transactions for permanent transfer. This is similar to the UK where transactions in both types of transfer are also fairly free. Leasing in the UK is also approximately half as large as permanent transfer. In the Netherlands the quota price for permanent transfer is about four times the milk price, whilst in the UK it is about 2-2 ½ times the milk price. In the Netherlands the
leasing price is less than 10 percent of the milk price, whilst in the UK it has generally been a much higher proportion, around one-quarter but getting up to one-half in the last year or so. In the UK the balance of advantage might seem in favour of buying than leasing, whereas in the Netherlands the reverse might be true. However, as has already been pointed out, the Dutch transfer prices are inflated artificially by the favourable tax treatment of quota purchase and probably also influenced by the efficiency of Dutch dairy farming and the good herd size structure of the owner-occupied family farms that typify the industry.

X. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF POLICY
In Chapter III of this study the performance criteria for the analysis of public policy (Effectiveness, Efficiency, Enforceability and Equity) were discussed broadly in the light of Sandiford and Rossmiller [1996] and EU policy making. In this chapter the performance criteria (the 4 Es) will be used to assess the policy delivery system (PDS) for the milk sector in the EU. The performance criteria are here being used endogenously: the focus of attention is a judgement of how effective and efficient the policy and its delivery system is in fulfilling the stated aims. Many discussions of the CAP (especially those emanating from the UK) usually implicitly adopt a marginalist approach in which judgement is passed on the system in relation to what the writer believes would be the outcome of a free-market situation. Such discussions frequently dismiss the aims of the policy without discussion and never consider the PDS. Nevertheless, the policy exists to fulfil the requirements of
Article 39 of the Treaty, which remains in its original form and as such is part of "the economic constitution" of the 15 member states. Moreover, the narrower aims of the policy legislation, particularly as stated in the articles of 804/68, remain the law of the EU. The EU has an agreement with the Contracting Parties of the GATT: this may require fundamental modifications to the milk policy but not to the Treaty, as Article 39 is not currently on the agenda of the Inter-Governmental Conference for the revision of the Maastricht Treaty. Therefore the analysis of the milk policy in this chapter simply considers the policy in relation to its aims and does not question the aims themselves.
Effectiveness The policy establishes (see Ch. IV above) the achievement of the Target Price for "the aggregate of producers' milk sales" as a principle aim, particularly having regard to the farm income objective. Producers should be able to attain the Target Price both "in the Community market and on external markets during the milk year". The first question therefore is to examine how far this has been achieved and then how far it results in "a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture". Some attention has to be given to the "stability" aim and finally the aim of ensuring "that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices". These are the desired results of the system and it can only be judged "effective" ("the top-level criterion") in so far as it delivers them.
Taking the Target Price levels first. Table 8 sets out the results of an analysis of the price of milk paid to producers by countries in the EU. No data is published of milk prices "delivered to dairies". Eurostat (the Communities' Statistical Office) publish data of ex farm prices for milk of 3.7 percent fat (excluding VAT and co-responsibility levy) in each country of the Community. For a number of countries some data on ex farm transport cost has been available through ASSILEC (now EDA). Although some years out of date, if taken as a rough proportion on historic series and projected it can be used as a reasonable approximation. Data on co-responsibility payments (in the relevant years) is available from national sources and, when not, can be estimated from partial and full exemption limits. No data on the cost of delivering to dairies was available for Italy. In the absence of information a figure of 4 percent of the ex farm price has been used, which could be too small
for Italy's very small herds or too large when milk is delivered by farmers themselves. More details of the making of the calculations in Table 8 have been set out each year in the annual editions of EC Dairy Facts and Figures down to the last year of its publication in 1995 (Residuary Milk Marketing Board [1995]).
The figures in Table 8 have already been the source of much debate in previous publications (e.g., Williams [1986] and [1993]). In the present context they suggest that, so far as the Community's first objective is concerned, the Target Price that it is aimed to achieve is more or less achieved. The countries analysed in Table 8 cover 92-93 percent of the milk supply in the Community, and the average price achieved (by weighting prices across countries in the columns) has been reasonably close to the Target Price. (Greece, Spain and Portugal have not been included; in Greece and Portugal producer prices are probably a little above the Target Price and in Spain somewhat below.) Although from the average of the figures in Table 8 it can be concluded that the system is quite clearly effective, the amount of variation in the system throughout the Community is very considerable. The end two columns of the table provide a mean of the figures for each country together with a
standard deviation for the years shown. At one extreme, the Republic of Ireland has generally had the lowest price (and also a high standard deviation) with prices sometimes below 90 percent of the Target Price, i.e., below the intervention milk equivalent price. At the other, Italian producers have had prices estimated to be as high as 130 percent of the Target Price. The most extreme range shown here occurred in 1991 with a difference of 44 percentage points between the Italian and Irish prices. The smallest range, in 1995, shows a difference of over nine percentage points as the Italian price has come down (see Ch IX). Ranges of this magnitude and variability could not reasonably have been said to have been the intention of the original designers of the policy who sought to eliminate variations that might occur through any arrangements that would protect local liquid milk prices. Explanations of price differences are complex and may relate to many structural differences
between countries, the size of processing/marketing organisations and economies of size (where the Dutch have an advantage), product differentiation especially in the cheese market (where the Italians appear to have had the biggest advantage although Denmark and the Netherlands also have a high utilisation of milk for cheese), brand loyalty, and finally the management and ownership of marketing organisations. Where the marketing system is owned by farmers through their co-operatives the return on their capital in the business is part of the price of milk returned to members (see Ch VII). (Previous publications by the present author have shown the disadvantage that UK producers have in this respect: Williams [1987] and the debate with Pitts, Haines and Jenkins [1987].) In so far as these are the reasons for the wide differences in prices received by farmers, it has to be said that, no matter what the conduct of the policy, it is difficult to see that much could be done. The
system has achieved the broad aim of the Target Price, as well as reasonable stability in so far as the doubling and halving again (twice) of the prices of butter and skim powder on world markets in the decade from 1986 to 1996 was only mildly felt in producer prices in the Community.

What of the achievement of the income aim? An in-depth and up-to-date analysis of dairy farm incomes is a substantial task and outside the scope of this study. However, Table 9 uses data from the Farm Accounts Data Network (FADN) for dairy farmers in the Community as a whole to show the trend over 12 years in the Net Value Added (NVA) per dairy farm and per annual work unit in ECUs. NVA represents the total return for all factors of production at factor cost used on the farm.
What represents "a fair standard of living" in different parts of the Community, and whether 25-28 000 ECUs per farm or 10 500 to 12 500 ECUs per work unit (in Sterling £7 500 to £8 500) is in fact "fair" is impossible to say. In any case, the variability in income between different parts of the Community and even individuals within the same areas is enormous. The most interesting feature of Table 9 is that although incomes fluctuate they have gone up over the period 1983/84 to 1990/91 (and have indeed about doubled) while the price paid to producers in ECUs has moved very little. Inflation in the 1980s has been at a much lower level than in the 1970s, which has made it easier for farmers to retain more of the benefits of productivity growth. It is in the period of the quota policy that incomes started to move up. The statistics are not complete and publication is always a number of years in arrears, but farmers have had relatively good years since 1990/91. The quota policy
does appear to have been flexible enough, both in the manner of its introduction and in the operation of the transfer system since, to have assisted the income aim of the overall policy. With the introduction of quotas, large numbers of very small producers left the industry with the assistance of outgoers' schemes that were very generous in some countries, and made quota available to assist those remaining to become larger. The subsequent transfer systems in most countries appear to have enabled the industry as a whole to take advantage of rising productivity while price has been stable. Producer numbers have, as a result, continued to decline and the incomes of farms remaining in production have increased. The pace at which farm incomes rise would seem, therefore, to depend very much on the speed of structural adjustment, which is of course assisted by stability. Violently fluctuating prices can give false hopes and wrong signals. It could be good luck that the quota
policy was established in a more stable and less inflationary period than the 1970s. Howsoever, the policy has been effective in its broad aim of bringing "the financial burden and market difficulties" of the late 1970s and early 1980s under control. At the time the intention was to have "the least drastic effect on the incomes of producers" compared with possible alternatives. Once stocks were reduced the budget cost was effectively contained, and the improvement of farm incomes might even be said to be an unexpected bonus. Moreover, most member states have succeeded in keeping to within one percent of their national reference quantities in most years. The effectiveness of the policy, especially in the avoidance of structural rigidity, has almost certainly been greater than most of those close to its initial design and implementation in late 1983 and early 1984 would have predicted.

Type 41 Holdings: Mainly dairy/specialist dairy. 63-66 percent of gross output = milk and 19-20 percent beef and veal. 14-18 percent of output is other products.
The free flow of goods and services within the Common Market has also been a principle aim of the Treaty. Whilst the milk sector has not yet developed large pan-European marketing organisations, the free flow of products in the dairy sector has been achieved. Trade flows between member states for the main dairy products demonstrate this. Almost one-third of cheese consumed in the EU as a whole is cheese that has been traded between member states. This proportion has gradually risen over the years, as has cheese consumption, and it is a reasonable presumption that widening consumer choice has been favourable to increased consumption. High proportions of butter and preserved milks are also traded between member states, as are skimmed milk powder and casein. The policy has, therefore, been effective in establishing an integrated milk and dairy products market in the EU as a whole.
Efficiency Has the policy achieved its aims at the least possible cost to taxpayers, consumers and other parties? The total cost of the policy is taken by some experts to be the budget cost plus the cost to consumers which is measured by the difference in prices on world markets and the internal level in the Community. There are few things in public debate more misleading. No-one could seriously believe that "the value of total monetary transfer from consumers and taxpayers to producers in 1994 came to more than 21 billion ECUs... or 63 percent of the total value of milk production in the EU". (Evidence of MAFF to the House of Commons Agriculture Committee, First Report, Session 1995-96 quoted para 27 p.xxiii.) That is a figure calculated by taking the difference between Community and world prices multiplied by the level of Community milk output and then added to the budget cost. The world market for dairy products is a small residual market resulting from the protectionist
policies of all the main milk producing and consuming countries in the world. Low world prices are the result of not only the Community's policies but also the United States' tight import quota controls that have virtually excluded imports of significant quantities of heavy milk using dairy products from the US, as well as the policies pursued by Canada, Scandinavia and other countries. There is no such thing as a global integrated economy so far as milk products are concerned. The only country to live by trade in dairy products on world markets, New Zealand, has a unique industry that produces milk highly seasonally entirely off grass from large herds of low-yielding but high-butterfat cows; annual fluctuations can be sharp, according to the effects of weather and grass growth.
The FEOGA budget cost of the milk price policy has been brought down from around 6 billion ECU in the mid-to-late 1980s to just over 4 billion ECU in the last few years. The farm price has been held steady or reduced slightly, while total quota has been reduced and farm incomes improved. Clearly efficiency has been improved, but the policy could still have some way to go before it might reasonably be judged "efficient". Taxpayers' money has been wasted in the disposal of large stocks of product: in the case of butter, the policy itself has destroyed the market, and in the case of skim powder it has led to the production of large quantities of a product for which there never has been anything but a very small market in commercial terms.
What of the efficiency of the implementation system itself with all its detail and complexity? The costs of storage and disposal schemes are, as has been shown, subject to tight central control by a small but powerful Commission staff and are met from the Community's own resources; but part of the administrative costs are incurred by national governments and on this there is no centralised information on staff numbers and costs. The total overall costs to taxpayers are therefore not known.
The system of producing product for intervention rather than the market certainly does not encourage efficiency, as it takes away from the industry's management part of their essential job, i.e., marketing the products they produce effectively. When product is not produced for the market, the organisations concerned are left with a deadened, purposeless feeling which is bad for morale and staff management throughout.
The big differences in the time period for payment of export refunds, which discussion of the PDS in different member states has exposed, seem very questionable on efficiency grounds. The movement of milk products from Italy to the Netherlands and from the UK to the Netherlands (assuming the products do in fact move) in order to export to third parties would certainly appear to be giving rise to excess movement and uneconomic routes. It would be reasonable to suppose that the more efficiently intervention agencies and the agencies paying export restitutions are managed, the lower will be the costs of support to the taxpayer and the consumer. All agencies should then make the payments due as fast as possible. If this results in improvement of producer prices, then support prices should be reduced by an offsetting amount. Producers would be no worse off while consumers and/or taxpayers would be better off. The idea that either the Commission should attempt to depress prices by
"playing the rules" or that individual member states should do so in implementing the system is to introduce deliberate management inefficiency to offset the inefficiencies of the political system in any fine tuning of support levels.
An important part of the policy in financial terms since 1977 was the co-responsibility levy until its abolition in March 1993. The substantial funds raised in some years were used to finance the school milk scheme and other projects, some of which were mere substitutes for the Commission's disposal schemes. Far too little of the money raised was used for commercial publicity, advertising, merchandising schemes and market research. The central control of the use of a very small part of the funds to improve markets and marketing (even to central approval for the smallest market research project) was a lost opportunity in the development of an efficient and imaginative policy. The dairy industry faces tough competition from substitute products produced by large and powerful global organisations, and such pressure is going to continue. The dairy industry is still national and in parts fairly fragmented, and it needs a much more imaginative policy from the centre to assist the
branding and marketing of its products than it has so far received.
Enforceability The policy for the milk sector has proved to be enforceable even when there have been disputes and difficulties. The main means of settling disputes in the Community is through the European Court, which has had to deal with a number of important cases in the milk sector (some of which have been mentioned in the course of this study). The "dual pricing" of milk for butter in the UK (Case 23/84. Commission versus the Government of the United Kingdom) was a case brought and won by the Commission. The right of the UK Milk Boards to require contributions from producer-retailers selling "heat-treated" milk was settled by the Court in the Boards' favour. The right of the Boards to require contributions on "low-fat" milk sales from producer-retailers under Regulation (EEC) 1422/68 was challenged by the Commission in the Court and in this instance the Commission lost. (Case 40/92. Commission versus the Government of the United Kingdom.) These instances, like others
affecting the running of the policy, have been relatively clear cut in their outcomes. Community law has been settled by the Court and the outcome enforced.
Cases of enforcement brought by the Commission involving the failure of a member state to fulfil its obligations are preceded by the delivery of a reasoned opinion in the matter, giving the state concerned the opportunity to submit its observations (Article 169). In the sphere of quotas the Court has settled cases relating directly to individuals that have had a policy-making effect. The most spectacular example from this point of view was that of Mr J Mülder versus the Dutch Government in which the Court found in favour of Mr Mülder. (Case 120/86. Mülder J versus Kingdom of the Netherlands (Minister van Landbouw en Visserij).) The substance of this case has already been discussed (see Ch VI); it was politically highly inconvenient as its effect was to give quota to a group that had been excluded, and this forced the need for adjustment on other producers right across the Community. In this instance the Court's decision limited the power of the government of a member state
in implementing Community policy.
The Community's most difficult case in applying the quota policy occurred, as we have seen, in Italy (Case 394/85. Commission versus the Republic of Italy) although there were also difficulties in Greece and Spain that have not been examined in this study. Each of these countries experienced considerable difficulty in applying the quota policy, partly through a lack of an adequate data base, and it took considerable political will and administrative effort to implement the policy fully. Nevertheless, it has been done. The Italian authorities experienced some civil disorder when payments were finally enforced at the individual level for the 1995/96 year. There is, however, no reason to believe that this will not be resolved. The system has proved enforceable in Italy as elsewhere.
Equity Equity as a criterion must concern itself with the redistributive effects of the policy. It has been pointed out already (Ch II) that it was the original intention of the CAP to target the family farm and to deliberately redistribute resources in its favour. Given this aim, many analysts argue that it would best be done through income grants of some kind met out of general taxation. A policy that uses high prices to achieve this end hits large families where food expenditure is a high proportion of family income particularly hard, and is inefficient as a policy because it benefits small farmers less than large farmers (who, arguably do not need help or, if they do, much less of it).
This is familiar and politically much fought over ground, and milk, being a labour-intensive agricultural product, is central to the argument. The distribution of gains and losses from the policy affects regions within member states and not merely contributions and receipts by member states to the FEOGA budget. High milk prices have undoubtedly been beneficial to the development of the rural economy in certain regions of the European Community. The rural economy in the regions of southern Ireland, northwest France, south-west Wales and Bavaria has benefited from the encouragement of milk production. To have designed an income grant system that might have done the same thing would certainly have been a difficult task, even if it were possible. High milk prices encouraged milk production in these far-apart areas and enabled farm units to grow in size and efficiency.
The EU has already implemented the 1992 MacSharry reforms that reduced cereal support prices with a compensation package for farmers to make agreement in the Uruguay Round of GATT possible. To fulfil its commitments under the GATT Agreement, modification is likely, as we shall see in the next chapter, to have to be made to the price and quota policy in the milk sector. Equity issues will probably remain in the forefront of the debate over the future policy for the milk sector, as support has to be "decoupled" from the price to reduce the output enhancing (trade reducing) nature of the support.
The Maastricht Treaty lays down (Article 130a):
"In order to promote its overall harmonious development, the Community shall develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic and social cohesion.
In particular, the Community shall aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions, including rural areas."
The Community undertook in the Treaty to use its main Structural Funds (the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, The European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund) for supporting the achievement of regional growth and social cohesion. The Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund is taking a gradually reducing share of overall Community funds, but still accounts for about half of total EU funds. Policies that satisfy the so-called "green box" criteria will need to be thrashed out if the EU commitments in the 1992 GATT Agreement of reducing support prices and export refunds, and increasing market access are to be fulfilled and a second round along similar lines is to be negotiated.
To satisfy the equity criterion, the policy has also to be seen to work reasonably even-handedly throughout the territory of all the member states of the EU. On this test it could be said that the policy is open to criticism. Disparities in prices obtained by producers have been wider than might be expected in a common market with free movement of goods. In the UK the government's policy on green rates of exchange has enhanced price differences in an effort to hold the balance of losses and gains from the system in favour of UK consumers. The operation of quotas shows many disparities of detailed treatment of producers between member states. The extent to which quotas may be exceeded without penalty by individual farmers varies widely between countries; the treatment of member states in the choice of Community base did rough justice; the differences in the handling of transfer issues varies enormously; fiscal treatment of quotas varies; member states' own government
contributions to outgoers' schemes varied widely in generosity; and there have been many other disparities. Nevertheless, quotas have brought benefits to farmers that have been large enough to push these disparities into the background so far as farmers have been concerned, and there is therefore a high level of support for quotas among the farming community throughout the EU.
Finally, there is the issue of reasonable prices to consumers, a subject little discussed except in the UK. The CAP'S opponents (ignoring the aims of policy) will always argue that the only reasonable or fair price is that of a free market. Defenders of the CAP can argue that what consumers spend on food as a proportion of their incomes in the EU is not only low but has declined considerably everywhere since 1968. The unequal effect on small and large families is also partly offset in many countries by social programmes. Consumer prices of food, moreover, in most countries of the EU (the UK excepted) are subject to value added tax (VAT), which means that the CAP is not the only government policy raising the price of food to consumers. For most governments of the EU consumer prices of food are not the most sensitive political issue surrounding the CAP.

XI. WTO/GATT AND THE FUTURE OF MILK POLICY
Managing a vast market is a continuous process and an intricate and complicated one. Pressures, both economic and political, build up until change in policy becomes inevitable. The biggest issue that is going to affect the future for milk policy is the GATT Agreement, which has already been referred to as affecting policy aims and objectives at the end of Ch. IV. The problems of adaptation in the longer term will be compounded by the problems of enlargement as the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) enter the EU, and may even be affected in the medium term by the attacks likely to be made on the EU's ban on the use of BST (bovine somatotrophin). The EU quota policy under present legislation lasts until the year 2000. What will be the future of this part of the policy? How far is the GATT Agreement likely to change the residual nature of the world markets for dairy products? How can policy makers for the EU dairy sector adapt the policy to fulfil the core aims of
the Community's agricultural policy? A brief examination of the main elements of the GATT Agreement and some comments on these wider issues will conclude this study.
The GATT Agreement requires the EU:
· to reduce export subsidies by 36 percent in six years from 1995 and the volume subsidised by 21 percent based on averages of 1986-90;
· to implement reductions in each of four commodity groups - butter and butter-oil, skim milk powder, cheese and "other products";
· to convert all non-tariff barriers into bound tariffs at a level corresponding to the difference between internal and world prices in a 1986-88 base period;
· to reduce all tariffs by an average of 36 percent over six years from 1995/96 with a minimum of 15 percent for each tariff line;
· to allow imports at reduced rates of duty for a volume of products accounting for a minimum of 3 percent of total milk requirements in 1993 and increasing to 5 percent of consumption over the six years;
· to reduce all subsidies affecting the level of production and therefore trade levels by 20 percent from the average of 1986-88. This is interpreted as a reduction in the "aggregated measures of support", but this is an area in which there were some differences of interpretation between the EU and other Contracting Parties.
It is not proposed to model each of these elements of the agreement in detail. Restriction of export refunds for the EU by 21 percent of the 1986-90 base will give, and is already giving, rise to problems. Some types of cheese to high-priced markets have been in the past, and will be more in the future, exported without refunds. However, there are two countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, that have by far the largest dependence on cheese exports outside the Community. Curtailment of export refunds for these countries is likely to result in some diversion of their exports, from third countries to countries within the Community, which will toughen competition on Community markets. In order to reduce cheese exports by the required amount for the Community as a whole, the Commission are seeking to implement the policy by a sharper reduction in export refunds for cheese than the agreement requires and a less sharp reduction in other products, thereby using export refunds
themselves as an instrument to achieve the quantitative restriction and diversion. The effect of this has already been felt and is leading to marketing changes.
The impact of the sharp cut in export refunds to reduce cheese exports is eased considerably by the fact that butter and skim powder exports were significantly higher in the base period than they have been subsequently. The Community has scope to increase butter exports by over 200 000 tonnes and skim powder by over 130 000 tonnes compared with the levels in 1994/95 in the early part of the six-year period. Even by the year 2001 butter exports can be 130 000 tonnes higher and skim powder 80 000 tonnes higher than in the base period. Cheese exports receiving a refund have to be cut, however, by 120 000 tonnes. While Denmark exports the largest proportion of its cheese production to third countries, it is a small country in milk output terms. The largest exporters of cheese to third countries are Germany, France and the Netherlands and therefore these countries are going to have to make the largest adjustment.
Increased access at lower tariff rates has to be given on 104 000 tonnes of cheese, 69 000 tonnes of skim powder and 10 000 tonnes of butter. Current access for New Zealand butter also has to be restored to the 1986-88 base from which it was cut, meaning a quota increase from just under 52 000 tonnes in 1994 to nearly 77 000 tonnes in 1995. This extra amount into the UK clearly more than offsets the Community's commitment on butter, and will divert more UK-produced butter into exports, leaving New Zealand with a very high proportion of the UK packet-butter markets (probably around 40 percent).
It is difficult to predict the likely consumption changes in the Community in the next few years, but there is some general agreement amongst analysts and commentators that the net effect of the cut in export refunds and the resulting diversions of trade, together with the requirements of increased access, will require the Community to cut its overall quota for milk between 1998 and 2000 by up to 4 percent if a crisis is to be averted. There is not universal agreement about this, and some (including the UK Government) argue that a crisis could be avoided through downward pressure on prices to raise internal consumption. The likelihood of general Community quota cuts of up to 4 percent by the turn of the century is fairly high if there is not to be a decline in prices, and therefore in dairy farm incomes, which might not be considered desirable.
In the Commission's submission of the EU Schedule of Commitments to GATT, a measure of "aggregate market support" was used that made a separate calculation for butter and skim milk powder. The figures were not translated into a milk equivalent value and multiplied by total deliveries to dairies. (There was a big difference here between the EU and the US.) Taking the agreed cuts in tariff equivalents between 1995 and 2000, as long as world prices of butter and skim powder do not fall below the average of 1993-95 it would not be necessary to reduce intervention prices until the end of the period. But there will have to be some reduction at the end of the period, and possibly before then if world markets become very depressed. At the beginning of 1997 tariff protection was such that Community prices for dairy products were 20-35 percent below world prices plus the import duty.
Clearly the requirements of the GATT Agreement are going to tighten on the EU dairy industry round about the turn of the millennium, and the next round of GATT negotiations are scheduled to commence in 2000 and conclude by 2003. There can be little doubt that, if a negotiated settlement commencing in 2004 were similar to the 1992 settlement, prices to dairy farmers in the period 2004 to 2010 would fall quite considerably. The alternative, if quotas are retained in 2000 when they come up for renewal, would be to cut quotas and allow imports a greater share of a high-price market.
The problems of a further round of GATT negotiations will be compounded by Community enlargement to include the CEECs. Here the Commission's own projections of the effects for the milk sector in their Agricultural Strategy Paper (European Commission, CSE (95) 607) are pessimistic:
".....(assume) as a working hypothesis that the negotiations on milk production quotas would leave some limited room for further expansion of dairy production in the new member states. The increase in milk prices would... dampen domestic utilisation in the CEEC's which would lead to an increase in the milk surplus by over 50 percent in 2005 compared to 2000. This surplus would be added to a rising surplus in the EU-15 where the decline in per caput use is expected to continue...."
This statement is very pessimistic; across the CEECs as a whole milk output fell by more than one-third in the first half of the 1990s; rising domestic prices can be moderated by longer transitional arrangements; improving living standards should help demand; and it is to be hoped that these countries retain some of their trading links with Russia. Russia is, however, the last very big butter market in the world to be attacked by the margarine manufacturers. It would therefore be hard to argue that enlargement of the Community is not going to make a difficult situation yet more difficult. Even the implementation of the policy in anything like the present detailed form with 25 members would be extremely cumbersome. Various "solutions" are being canvassed to the Community's milk sector problems. One solution would be to reduce the support price drastically until surpluses disappeared and to compensate farmers by means of some form of grant (headage payments, transferable
bonds, annual payments related to quota, etc). One of the variants of this proposal is that support prices should be reduced before enlargement but still leaving room for raising prices in new member states. The compensation payment would then apply only to producers in existing member states keeping the budget cost within reasonable bounds. This proposal would leave the enlarged Community with two classes of dairy farmer for a long period, which may give rise to problems either in initial negotiations or at a later stage. It would mean that the agricultural policy was being applied discriminately. Article 40 of the Treaty required that the "... pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 39... shall exclude any discrimination between producers or consumers within the Community".
Another proposal is that the quota policy should be changed to a two-tier one. Under this proposal there would be two types of quota: A Quota which would cover milk paid for at the full support price (or most of it) and B Quota which would be for milk used for producing products for export with no subsidy. A system of this type has been ably advocated by some quarters in the Community, and it would certainly modify the operation of the present quota system substantially - there would be no need to lease quota, for example, and the super-levy calculation would be modified. However, it would probably lead to a substantial lift in Community milk production, that would affect world markets and the cost of disposing of A-quota milk whose supply might then have to be reduced. Because the scheme would be output enhancing and likely to increase the overall costs of support (through the price effect), it would be likely to be incompatible with the EU's GATT commitments.
No blueprint for future Community policy in the milk sector will be attempted. It is highly likely, although not certain, that quotas will be rolled over again in 2000 with possibly a small cut either at the time or before. Producers in both France and Germany, where farmers' political influence is strongest, are certainly in favour of quotas, and on qualified majority voting on a proposal from the Commission in the Council quotas would probably be retained. The present GATT Agreement will not create anything like a genuine international global market in dairy products. Trade in dairy products represents no more than about 6-7 percent of world consumption, a proportion that is not likely to change greatly before 2000. An agreement to cuts in support arrangements from 2004 similar to 1992 would make a considerable difference before the end of the first decade of the 21st century. To enable a further GATT round to be successfully negotiated, an arrangement to reduce the milk
support price with a compensation package (similar to the MacSharry reform for cereals prior to the 1992 agreement) will have to be negotiated. Such a package is likely to be difficult for milk, having regard to the Treaty obligations and other complications within the EU. Each of these major steps - dealing with quotas, dealing with an internal support package and negotiating a GATT deal that leads to equitable and politically acceptable arrangements - will be a difficult task. Success would lead to greater efficiency in the marginalist sense of coming closer to a free market by around 2010. The greatest difficulty may be in finding ways of ensuring that the aims of the Treaty remain achievable.
The Community is committed to the implementation of its policy of enlargement. There can be no doubt that this will force on the Community a policy of simplification in the running of the system. What was possible with six member states became strained with 15 member states and may be rendered impossible with 25. The Commission strategy paper already referred to recognises this. The most minute control of intervention management down to the smallest detail requiring hundreds of amending and re-amending Regulations will have to be reformed. Such reforms will need to ensure that the industry marketing organisations are much more involved than they have been, with better incentives to market products to best advantage. A lower-price milk regime in the 21st century would itself ease the path towards simplification and greater local control over the running of a common system.
Whilst simplification of the means of operating price support will be necessary in an enlarged Community, the same thing will apply to quota management, assuming it continues. The Community may have to accept the large amount of difference there is in the management of quotas between member states, and accept also that this is likely to happen in the eastern European countries as well. Retaining the quota system or rolling it over again is likely to result in its national basis remaining. Trading quota across national borders seems a very unlikely development. Indeed, some governments have already ring-fenced quota movement within their own countries to prevent quota moving out of difficult areas. Under these circumstances agreement to a policy allowing movement across national borders is unlikely.
Looking forward into the 21st century, will there be an end to the mercantilist style of agricultural policies of the 20th century? The EU through enlargement has gradually spread competitive marketing into a wider area of Europe while remaining faithful to the core aims of the Treaty. This seems likely to continue. Through the GATT (Uruguay Round) Agreement EU agriculture is starting to become inter-dependently integrated in the world trading system. If this is to develop further, there will undoubtedly be demands for some degree of equitable and agreed control over world trade in milk and dairy products, a control that will need to be exercised by the new World Trade Organisation (WTO). The outcome should be a much larger level of trade than the 6-7 percent of world consumption that has been traded throughout long periods of the 20th century. The rules of the WTO will have to be kept as simple as possible, but enforceable, with targeted and meaningful penalties for
transgression. A controlling body with agreed representation, making decisions by qualified majority voting will need to link access to world markets to remaining support levels, and also agree a stock control policy for key products.
The major part of current world trade is carried out by large organisations that need to be consulted regularly. New Zealand's exports, for example, are all made through a single body, the New Zealand Dairy Board; Dutch and Danish exports are through a handful of large organisations. Information systems can be swift and accurate. An enlarged Community, dealing with other groupings of nations around the world that will also face problems with their dairy sectors, stands a better chance of establishing a globalised policy for this important sector of agriculture than has been the case throughout the 20th century.

There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip. (Trad.)
1. Introduction
This paper is the work of two agricultural policy economists who have been working in the development business advising governments on various aspects of agricultural policy. Much has been changing in the policy arena, domestically and internationally, emphasizing the dynamic nature of agricultural policies and the need for good information to guide the policy process. Our experiences have underlined the need for us to look more closely at how policy is implemented: there's many a slip 'twixt the Treasury cup and the farmer's lip. But how is the spillage occurring, and who is lapping up the drops? Does it matter, and, if so, to whom?
These questions are not new, but, as this paper shows, they have been given a different slant and a new imperative by changes that have occurred in the policy implementation environment over the last few years. We are therefore trying to develop a framework for structured thinking about policy implementation that will assist us to do our policy advisory job better. Although our approach is necessarily pragmatic, we are having to re-evaluate much that we have hitherto taken for granted in the context of our economic training and political culture. The framework being developed awaits field-testing, as well as the further development of the more conceptual side of the work. By means of this paper, we hope to stimulate more agricultural policy economists to rise to the practical and theoretical challenges posed.
2. The changing world of agricultural policy implementation
The 1980s and 1990s have seen radical changes in several developed countries in the form of the separation or distancing of policy advice, policy formation and policy implementation. This has perhaps been most noticeable in that special political tradition and culture known as the Westminster system,³ but has also occurred in Denmark and Sweden, in terms of the changing role of the civil service, and the separation of the different functions formerly encompassed by one government department. Understanding why and how this has occurred matters because some of the new arguments are being used by the IMF and the World Bank in their advice to developing countries and the transition economies, which is then incorporated into loan conditionalities.
(^3 The Westminster system of government and variants thereof are found in Britain, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and many former colonies. It is based on a well-defined relationship between the executive, the legislature and the electorate, and between government and the bureaucracy - the civil service. It is characterized by a ministerial executive and ministerial control of departments of state. Ministers are responsible for their departments with which they have a two-way communication: advice is passed upwards from the department to the minister and ultimately the cabinet, and decisions for implementation are passed downwards back to the department. All parties are assumed to share a common goal - the national interest.)
The story begins with public choice theory. Modern welfare economics has largely focused on the normative theory of public choice, which leads to policy recommendations that will increase some measure of social welfare. The strong Pareto criterion, and the somewhat weaker Kaldor-Hicks and Scitovsky criteria, provided strict standards for policy evaluation. But the policies actually adopted have often been considerably different from those advocated by economists on welfare grounds. This discrepancy tended to be seen by economists as a failure by politicians to resist pressure from interested parties acting in their private interests rather than the public welfare (Martin 1990).
Given such a normative basis, the approach of economists to policy implementation has often been to analyse policy impacts. The analyst usually assumes implicitly that the set of policy measures is embedded in a system in which they always work perfectly and do exactly what they are intended to do. If the analysis determines that the policy objectives will not be met, or that there are unwanted adverse consequences, it is the fault of the unique configuration of policy measures. The solution is to configure a different set of measures, usually much more complex in order to negate the potentially adverse effects of Plan A, designated Plan B.
The political tradition and culture within which this normative economic analysis in fact takes place tends to be viewed as a malfunctioning black box that is somewhere "out there". One outcome has been a huge gulf between independent agricultural economic analysts who stand outside the black box, and agricultural economists in advisory positions who work inside the black box.^4 (Standen (1983), for example, expressed concern about advisory economists being any longer able to find a professional home in the Australian Agricultural Economics Society.)
(^4International policy advisors are a different animal in that they do not work inside a single black box for very long, but must develop the ability to work inside any black box very quickly. They are therefore closer to the second group, but their training and experience is often as members of the first group.)
In contrast to the normative "national interest" theory of public choice, the modern positive theory takes a private interest view of the policy process and provides a framework for analysing the roles of politicians, bureaucrats and interest groups in an attempt to explain governments' actions (Martin 1990, and Johnson 1994). Instead of seeing pressures to further private interests as an obstacle to the optimal functioning of the political process, they are seen as rational actions by individuals and groups to improve their own welfare.
Against this background the traditional role of the economic policy analyst is at best diminished, at worst non-existent (but see Standen 1983).
However, positive public choice theory was hijacked by the normative brigade, including fiscal bureaucrats, and used to justify and shape major reorganization of the institutional and ideological structure of the public sector as part of an effort to control unsustainable fiscal deficits (Schwartz 1996). Public choice theory stresses the self-interest of politicians and bureaucrats who forge alliances with various interest groups to further their own ends. Private interests are therefore pursued to the detriment of the social good. On this view of the world, the role of the state should be minimized,^5 and the power of its agents (politicians, agencies, state-run monopolies) to engage in rent-seeking activities must be curbed. Since government departments have a vested interest in their own survival, and expansion, so the argument runs, they should not both advise policy makers and implement policy^6.
(5 In the American political system with its highly politicized civil service and pre-existing separation of policy responsibilities, the emphasis has been much more on reducing the role of the state per se under the guise of reducing the budget (otherwise known as getting the politicians out of politics).)
(^6 For quite different reasons, membership of the EU has also led to a distancing of policy advice, policy making and policy implementation, with key agricultural policy objectives being decided in Brussels on the basis of discussions and horse-trading between the governments (advised by their national policy advisers) and the European Commission (with their own policy advisers), and implemented by the member states.
The consequences of the above-mentioned processes for the political system and public accountability are far-reaching, and way beyond the scope of this paper. What concerns us is the profound impact that the thinking has had on policy implementation. In particular, the reorganizers have attempted to institute markets and market disciplines for the provision of government-produced goods and services. The four key changes that were introduced (Schwartz op. cit.) were: (a) to impose private-sector labour practices on public sector labour (to let managers manage); (b) to manage by results with output rather than input budgeting; (c) to concentrate strategic decision-making into small teams (to manage the managers); and (d) to abolish or undermine a monopoly over service provision. Agriculture has not been excluded. In the UK, for example, the delivery of agricultural advisory services has been fully commercialized, but the process leading to this took the Agricultural
Development and Advisory Service (ADAS) through a series of staged reforms of service provision (Dancey 1993); in New Zealand, the agricultural ministry's science functions have been transferred to ten new crown research institutes, and the extension service has been sold off to a private sector company; in many developed countries, user fees are now being charged for the provision of agricultural extension, diagnostic and laboratory services.
Throughout the developing world, these ideas are being used by international advisers to inform the policy advice they give without adequate consideration of the specific and very different conditions pertaining in those countries. Thus we hear of policy advice to introduce "the new managerialism" into the public service in countries that have no recent experience of any western-style business management anywhere in the economy. Loan conditionalities include massive reductions in the size of the public sector and concomitant delivery of services by the private sector where no functioning private sector yet exists.
To assert that because public servants will act to further their private interests rather than the public good, they should be replaced by or subjected to the disciplines of the private sector, which is admitted to act in its own private interest, seems a bizarre chain of reasoning. There are indeed compelling reasons for concern about government delivery of agricultural policies (Roberts 1995), especially in the area of service provision, but also in the delivery of financial benefits such as subsidized credit or inputs. Firstly, public employees often have little incentive to deliver policies effectively and efficiently, especially as regards timeliness. Secondly, incentives to further private interests are often strong - perhaps strong enough to be realized as corruption. Thirdly, public provision of services that can in principle be provided by the private sector can stifle private sector development. Lastly, public service provision has an inherent tendency to be
ineffective (i.e., to do the wrong thing (Drucker 1990)) because it is supply, not demand, driven. Yet privatizing policy implementation or "marketizing" public sector implementation will not automatically overcome these problems - after all, public and private sector actors are all human beings, and the activities of the private sector are far from being uniformly transparent or efficient. And both public and private sector organizations that rely on policy delivery to justify or financially support their existence have a strong private interest in the continuation of that policy.
The separation or distancing of policy implementation from policy making and policy advice challenges the policy economist to cease taking it as a given that lies outside his or her proper sphere of responsibility.^7 Additional impetus is provided by the new institutional economics, which asserts that institutions matter and that they are susceptible to analysis (Williamson 1994), and therefore complements the contribution made by public choice theory. The rest of this paper focuses on agricultural policy implementation as a subject for systematic study in its own right.
(^7 Agricultural policy implementation has not been addressed systematically in the literature, although there is some comparative description in Krueger 1992. In contrast, the explanation of agricultural policy choices and the role of policy advisers have received some attention (Rausser 1982, Standen 1983, Martin 1990, Krueger 1992, Swinnen and van der Zee 1993, and Johnson 1994). Of particular interest are Martin's examination of recent policy reforms in Australia in the light of extensions to the private interest model and Johnson's ex post examination of 18 New Zealand agricultural policies to see whether, judging by six criteria, a particular policy decision supported the private interest argument. Only five policies were found to be unambiguously private interest. The rest were rather mixed, but with the orientation much more towards the public interest.)
3. Agricultural policy implementation: The policy delivery system
The unit for studying agricultural policy implementation is the policy delivery system, which we define as being the total modality of implementing a given policy. The first question to be addressed is what constitutes an agricultural policy delivery system. Our definition includes the unique set of institutions, individuals, processes and rules that together deliver the benefits of the policy to a target group and enable control to be exercised to ensure adherence to the rules of access.
As such, policy delivery systems are almost infinitely variable. Consider a couple of examples. Assume a policy objective of increasing farm incomes, and that the instrument selected is an import tax. The policy delivery system consists of border controls and tax collection, and the domestic market, which acts as the mechanism for transmitting the price effect to the farm gate. The extent to which the policy delivery system succeeds in achieving the policy objective will depend, inter alia, on the extent to which the border controls are policed and the degree of price transmission by the market.
Now assume the same objective of increasing farm incomes but through the provision of extension advice to increase farm productivity. The policy delivery system in this case includes (but is by no means limited to) the transmission of relevant and useful technical, economic and business information, which could be by government or private agencies, or some combination. Our understanding of policy delivery systems encompasses all types of agricultural policies be they pricing policies or service provision, whether they involve public goods, private goods or something in between. By looking at policy implementation as a delivery system, we are able to cope with the complexity and sheer diversity of agricultural policy implementation schemes. Note that failures of policy delivery systems to implement agricultural policies are not limited to developing countries, and the issues raised have widespread applicability.
4. Studying policy delivery systems: The structure-conduct-performance paradigm
We are looking towards a framework for structured thinking about policy delivery systems that can assist us in making the policy advice we give more relevant, reliable and workable. This means above all that it must be context-specific: it is the analytical framework that we need to be able to carry with us to each country, not the results of our using it elsewhere^8. The corollary to this is that we must gain an understanding of the specific context within which we are using the framework. Some feeling for history is helpful - the legacies of the past affect how things work in the present, and may constrain what is possible. Thus, for example, the Ottoman Empire, Soviet-style communism and colonial rule had different consequences for the type of bureaucracy that has been inherited, as well as for the legal system and attitudes to the law. Geography, politics and macroeconomics also need to inform our understanding of the situation in the country and its relationships with
other countries. A country analysis is therefore the overall starting point, and might need further development if an alternative to the existing policy delivery system as a whole is indicated.
(^8 It is perhaps worth stressing that we are not seeking to develop a prescriptive model of wide applicability based on hypothetical-deductive reasoning. While detailed study of several policy delivery systems in different countries might enable more general inferences to be drawn that could help to improve the analytical framework, that is not the object of the exercise, which is to assist in studying the particular case.)
In order to structure our thinking about policy delivery systems, we take as our point of departure some of the ideas from the structure-conduct-performance approach to analysing markets developed since the 1930s in the industrial organization literature (McKie 1970, and Phillips 1970). At its simplest, the market structure-conduct-performance paradigm attempts to evaluate market performance in the form of output and prices in relation to firms' conduct (behaviour) and the market structure of the industry (which are themselves inter-related). This approach has more recently been adapted to assess the behaviour and performance of governments rather than firms (Siamwalla and Haykin 1983) in the world rice market. Here, the structure of the world rice market is described as a thin residual market. The conduct of countries participating in the market is analysed to see how policies affect the traded volume, and the market structure. The performance of the market is then assessed
in terms of stability, static and dynamic efficiency, and income distribution.
In adapting the structure-conduct-performance paradigm to the analysis of policy delivery systems, which takes us beyond the neo-classical criteria for studying market behaviour, we incorporate an exogenous^9 reference point: the policy objective. Our framework must therefore allow for the definition of policy objectives, a description of system structure, an analysis of system conduct, and an assessment of the system's performance. In the following sections, we address each of these separately and discuss the major points that need to be covered at each stage. Reference to the four country examples and associated flow diagrams in the appendix may be of assistance in elaborating some of the points.^10
(^9 As the discussion in Section 4.1 suggests, the analysis could have the effect of endogenizing the objective to some extent. This is only likely to be a problem for studying the policy delivery system if at some stage the goalposts are moved from the rugby pitch to the football field.)
(^10 References to the examples in the appendix are abbreviated in this section as follows:

K2.eg = Korea: Agricultural Input Supply
SL.eg = Sierra Leone: Marketing of Export Crops)
4.1 Defining policy objectives
The first stage in using the structure-conduct-performance framework to study a particular policy delivery system is to obtain a working and workable definition of the policy objective, and to obtain the government's agreement to that definition. This is usually not easy for two reasons.
Firstly, most policy objectives as stated in political speeches and preambles to legislation are of a God, mother, country and apple pie nature. They are broad, ambiguous, sometimes contradictory. The job, and the art, is to infer the precision from such documents and from interviews with policy makers, bureaucrats and others. Even then, one might still get it wrong because politicians and bureaucrats, for a variety of reasons including the furtherance of private interests, might want to maintain the ambiguity. Perhaps in countries that have introduced arms-length policy implementation and the new managerialism, the management targets as determined might be thought to serve as an adequate interpretation of the policy objective - but the analyst should take a properly sceptical view of this and avoid creating a new black box that then avoids proper investigation.^11
(^11 Performance targets might be too narrowly defined to be an adequate proxy for the overall objective. They might also have been set to exclude an important but unstated part of the political agenda: for example, who takes the responsibility in the UK if a Chief Executive fulfils his performance targets, but does or fails to do something that causes political problems for the minister "responsible"? Or they might not take account of quality.)
Secondly, the stated objective, even if precisely defined, may have little or nothing to do with the real objective. Witness, for example, the (real) political objective versus the (stated) agricultural objective in the delivery of agricultural inputs by the National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation in Korea (K2.eg).
All of this means that defining the policy objective is not a one-off act; rather it is an iterative and interactive process. The definition needs to be questioned throughout the analysis. If something does not fit (such as the fertilizer grey market in Korea, K2.eg), we need to think about it and retrace our steps - again and again if necessary.
4.2 Describing structure
The structure component of the analysis focuses on the system through which the policy is implemented to transfer the benefits from wheresoever they derive to the hands of the targeted recipients. It is both a description of the policy delivery system - institutions, instruments and processes - and an analysis of the functions that are apparently intended to be performed at each point and by each component of the system. We say "apparently intended" because again one must take a sceptical approach given the potential for hidden agendas and private interests in the working of the system.
In looking at structure, the following points should be covered:
· a description of the policy instruments and how they complement or conflict with each other;
· a description of the formal and informal rules, regulations and safeguards built into or assumed to be inherent in the system in the attempt to ensure that the benefits flow to the targeted recipients and to monitor the eligibility of the participants, and other rules for compliance;
· a description of the institutions with functional responsibilities within the system and the specific functions they are supposed to perform; and
· an analysis of the functions supposed to be performed, including the processes, the actions and the actors involved in the working of the system.
The structure component of the analysis is heavily descriptive and should reflect the system as it is apparently intended to be, and to operate. On the basis of the findings, a flow diagram can be prepared (see K1.eg, K2.eg and SL.eg).
4.3 Analysing conduct
The conduct (or behaviour) component of the analysis covers how the institutions and individuals in the system operate to ensure and monitor compliance and effect delivery of the benefits to the targeted recipients. Or how they might be operating, given the opportunities, pressures and constraints, to deliver outcomes that are inconsistent with the original objectives of the policy. This is an analysis of the way the system works in practice -the actual as opposed to intended functions performed, where and how private or extraneous interests and activities affect the way the system works.
The conduct component is strongly investigative and analytical. It covers the same points as the structure component, but from a different standpoint. The aim is to lay out how the system really works as opposed to how it is apparently intended to work - to pinpoint where in the system and how, with what consequences for outcomes, actual conduct or behaviour affects system operation. On the basis of the findings of the conduct component, a modified flow diagram can be prepared to illustrate how and where the apparent intentions and the real world diverge (see K1.eg, K2.eg and SL.eg).
4.4 Assessing performance
Finally, the performance component of the analysis is an assessment of how well the policy delivery system meets the original objective of the policy in terms of delivering the scheduled benefits to the targeted recipients. We propose four criteria for this assessment of performance: effectiveness, efficiency, enforceability, and equity, each of which is elaborated below. A note of caution: these criteria are not tidy categories of mutual exclusivity; they overlap and interact. The points that need to be examined under each heading will differ from case to case, as will the relative importance of each criterion. The issues raised here are indicative rather than exhaustive, and the practitioner must necessarily work on a fairly ad hoc basis.
· Effectiveness:
Doing the right thing. This is the top-level criterion in that it is the overall measure of whether the policy objective is being achieved, which is why agreement about the policy objective is so vital. Effectiveness means that the system operates in such a way as to be successful in producing the desired result, i.e., it is capable of delivering the intended benefits to the targeted recipients and, indeed, does so. A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for effectiveness is that the system is capable of delivery. To be fully effective, the system must actually deliver. The other three performance criteria-efficiency, enforceability and equity - are second-level criteria that jointly contribute to overall effectiveness.
One of the attributes of system effectiveness is whether the system is structured and behaves to generate management information about itself. This information is needed not only to assess the workings of the policy delivery system per se but also to provide feedback to policy advisors and policy makers,
i.e., as an input into the dynamic agricultural policy process. On the assumption that it does not, or that the performance study is intended in part to check the accuracy of the information that is produced, the study of structure and conduct needs to be carried out such that the data and information needed to assess effectiveness are collected.
· · Efficiency:
Doing the thing right. This criterion looks at the cost of delivering the policy to the targeted recipients. It is contingent upon effectiveness: what if the system spends the benefits but the targeted beneficiaries do not receive them? In this construct, efficiency has no real meaning if effectiveness is not fulfilled. In other words, does it mean anything if the wrong thing is done right?
There are a number of things to consider in the context of efficiency.
The first is the need to make a clear distinction between the costs of the policy itself, and the costs of delivering the policy. The former is not an efficiency question as far as studying the policy delivery system per se is concerned, if the source of the benefits is external to the system. However, in some cases such as input supply or output marketing organizations (see SL.eg), the policy delivery system has to generate as well as distribute the policy benefits. Efficiency therefore needs to consider efficiency of benefit creation and also efficiency of benefit delivery. In these cases only should "leakage" of benefits be examined under the efficiency criterion: normally it should come under the other three performance criteria. In contrast, "leakage" of delivery costs is always an efficiency issue in this framework (e.g., if a delivery charge is being paid for a service or benefit that is not actually being delivered or is being delivered at a lower cost than is
claimed).
Then there is the total cost of policy delivery. There is generally a trade-off between the level of effectiveness and the implementation cost. For example, additional personnel to monitor compliance adds to the cost but improves effectiveness. In principle, one could add compliance officers until 100 percent coverage was almost unavoidable (assuming they do their job) or until the benefits saved from non-targeted recipients by the last officer added was equal to the cost of the officer, although in practice this would normally be difficult to achieve. Providing information to policy makers about the trade-offs involved might be useful so that the definition of the policy objective, the choice of policy instruments or the policy delivery system as a whole can be re-evaluated. In efficiency terms, the main question to be addressed is whether the total cost of achieving a given level of effectiveness is as low as is reasonably possible. For instance, some information can be
gained about the level of efficiency (including delivery cost "leakage") of the organizations involved in the delivery system (see Krueger 1992), even if this is rather partial and subjective. And all other things being equal, economics can throw some light on the relative efficiency of the policy instruments being used. The ceteris paribus assumption is critical because some instruments are just not usable, i.e., ineffective, in some circumstances, and others might have such high information needs that the true cost of using them would be astronomical.
One can also look at the unit costs of delivery, and whether there are economies or diseconomies of delivery in terms of the number of units delivered and the size of each unit. The delivery of credit subsidies is a case in point where the average cost of servicing a loan is largely invariant with the size of the loan. Total delivery costs can therefore be reduced by lending a larger sum to a mutually responsible group of farmers rather than several small loans to individual farmers (which would tend to increase effectiveness) or by lending larger sums to fewer large and medium-size farmers (which would tend to reduce effectiveness). Similar arguments apply to the delivery of extension services, but the question of quality then comes into the picture and whether, therefore, one is comparing like with like.
It follows that the efficiency incentives to achieve effectiveness depend in some cases on the way in which delivery costs are reimbursed - on a total cost or a unit cost basis. This is therefore another aspect of efficiency that the analysis must consider.
A major problem with assessing efficiency is that alternatives are not always available for comparison. One approach is to try to build efficiency in from the outset by putting policy delivery out to competitive tender. However, this has limited applicability in many countries, and has shown mixed results where it has been tried. In any event, it does not answer questions about the efficiency of an existing policy delivery system. There are occasions when proxy measures can be informative: for example, the financial health of a rural bank provides a measure of the efficiency with which the organization is being run, even though this does not answer questions about the effectiveness of credit delivery to the target group.
· · Enforceability:
The ability to make sure that the benefits reach the targeted beneficiaries, non-complying or unintended beneficiaries are excluded, and that benefits are not creamed off by intermediaries. Enforceability is not the same as enforcement, but is a pre-condition for it. Unenforceability could be de jure if the policy goes against formal rules of legality or constitutionality; or de facto if it is not in conformity with informal rules (see K1.eg);13 or it will occur if society or the groups within society that count have formed a consensus that the values represented by the policy are bad and the rules are wrong (see SL.eg). Prohibition in the US, the poll tax in England, and milk quotas in Italy are examples.
(^12Cases may be rare, but one can think of the legal position of a statutory marketing board under EU rules, or the constitutionality of certain types of land reform schemes.)
(^13 For instance, the existence of informal but socially accepted property rights that are not enforceable at the formal legal level will nevertheless constitute a barrier to enforceability of policies that ignore their existence.)
Given enforceability, non-enforcement can take place for three main reasons (see SL.eg). Someone in the system does not want to enforce the rules, perhaps for private gain. Or the costs of enforcement - in time, skills or money - exceed the benefits. Or there could be inequitable access to the organs of enforcement.
· · Equity:
Ensuring consistent and impartial access under the rules to the benefits across the targeted recipients. Again, equity must be seen in the context of the objective of the policy itself. Equitable access does not mean equal access; the most inequitable thing that can be done is to treat unequals as equal. Equity is the assurance of equal opportunity to access to the benefits under the rules. If the potential beneficiary qualifies under the rules of the game access to the benefits is assured, if not, access is denied. One might question whether the rules themselves lead to an equitable result, but that is a different matter all together. As a performance criterion, equity must be assessed in the context of the given rules of access (see K2.eg). For example, if the system is set up to provide a fixed price support on ail units of production, large producers will benefit more than small producers. This is equitable given the rules - even though one might question that concept
of equity in the grander scheme of things - as long as small producers are not refused access because of their smallness (or female-ness, political colour or some other irrelevant attribute) or because the unit costs of delivery to small producers are higher.
This interpretation of equity is concerned with the impartiality and consistency of the policy deliverer. From the point of view of the intended beneficiary, there is another equity consideration: the costs of access. If, for example, the agency that procures at a government-supported price has very few purchase points, those farmers located furthest away from the purchase points might face very high transport costs. Or information about the policy benefits and how to take advantage of them might be restricted to literate farmers or those with access to a radio (or Internet), imposing high search costs on some groups if the policy is to be accessible for them.
(^14 The Milk Marketing Board (E&W) was a good example of 100 percent equity with regard to this aspect of access because of its statutory duty to collect milk from any farmer who complied with certain conditions.)
Assessing performance is obviously a complicated process, and will produce a great deal of information that needs to be assimilated purposively. We therefore need to be quite clear about what we want the process to lead to. This depends on the reason for the study being undertaken in the first place. One of the following three is probable:
- There are grounds for believing that the effectiveness of the system is inadequate, and what is required are recommendations for improving the working of the system, assuming that we find it to be capable of improvement, or for setting up an alternative system.
- The government wishes to change the policy instruments for reasons unconnected with the effectiveness of the delivery system, e.g., to comply with GATT/WTO commitments or to reduce the costs of the policy itself, and wants to know if an existing policy delivery system can be used.
- For ideological or budgetary reasons, changes to an existing policy delivery system are under consideration, e.g., the privatization of a parastatal marketing organization or a reduction in the number of public sector personnel who provide extension services.
One further point is worth making about analysing very complex systems. Suppose the policy objective is to increase agricultural productivity and total production of a particular commodity through the widespread adoption of higher-yielding varieties. There are many and varied components to a policy delivery system for achieving this objective. The best way of handling a case like this is to break the system up into sub-systems, each with its own imputed objective, for the purposes of structure-conduct-performance analysis. The assessment of performance will then need to cover each subsystem separately, and also the performance of the system as a whole.
5. Where next for studying policy delivery systems?
Our future work on studying policy delivery systems will need to concentrate on two distinct aspects: the practical and the conceptual, concurrently rather than consecutively because each aspect informs the other.
In practical terms, the ideas presented in the structure-conduct-performance framework for structured thinking about agricultural policy delivery systems need to be further developed through field-testing into a tool that can be used by agricultural policy consultants. Thus far, we have been able only to re-evaluate some of our past experiences in the light of the framework, as the examples in the appendix show. Even so, this has been of great assistance in identifying areas for consideration under each performance criterion. Our hope is to take the ideas presented in Section 4 of this paper as a basis for studying a number of different agricultural policies in one country in order to modify and improve the approach, and to prepare guidelines for its application, including a checklist of questions. Ideally, we should then undertake more field-work to refine the technique.
On the conceptual side, the most urgent need is to look into the performance criteria in greater depth and to use the insights from different disciplines, and from other perspectives in our own discipline in order to extend and develop our thinking about efficiency, enforceability and equity, and also structure and conduct. In this regard, the work on positive public choice theory and the new institutional economics (North 1994, Williamson 1994, Putnam 1994, Murrell 1994, Shaffer 1995) has an important contribution to make because of the insights offered into studying the behaviour of real-world institutions (and their structure) and individuals. The stress that the new institutional economics lays on context specificity is refreshing and encouraging for us as policy practitioners - who know only too well the importance of understanding the country-specific context and the dangers of trying to import ideas that have worked well in one place and time into another place and
time. "The new institutional economics presents a polymorphic economic landscape, with a deep historical contingency underlying the development and the functionality of each institution. There is thus a need to examine that functionality within a particular historical, social, political and cultural context." (Murrell 1994.) Conversely, our practical work may be able to assist in applying some of those ideas to developing country economies.

APPENDIX to ANNEX I
While we have not had the opportunity to field-test the framework for structured thinking about policy delivery systems developed in the paper, we have reached back into some of our previous experience to provide some partial examples of how we might have applied it had we had the framework at the time. This exercise was particularly useful because in rethinking our own experiences we were able to identify gaps in the framework: to some extent, therefore, its development has already been strongly inductive. We must caution that the examples are incomplete since memory is imperfect and there are information gaps as the focus of our analysis at the time was not the policy delivery system.
Example 1. Agricultural Statistics Collection in the Republic of Korea (K1.eg)
The South Korean Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) is responsible for collection of agricultural area, yield and production statistics, including crop estimates. The policy of MAF was to produce these statistics on a timely basis and as accurately as possible. To that end, MAF had ample field enumerators who were well trained in sampling techniques and statistical enumeration. It was evident that the MAF enumerators were doing a conscientious, excellent job.
Yet when the production figures were adjusted to account for exports, imports, seed and post-harvest losses, converted to calories and divided by population, the only conclusion that could be drawn was that every Korean should weigh about 400 pounds (182 kg). When the adjusted production figures were compared with household consumption survey data, which were believed to be quite accurate, a systematic upward bias was found in the production time series data ranging between 12 percent and 20 percent for the cereals, rice, barley and wheat.
The structure of the policy delivery system was the cause. The MAF field enumerators turned over their results to the county (Gun) administration for aggregation and passing on to the province level where they were aggregated again and sent to Seoul for final aggregation at the national level. The offices responsible for aggregation of the data at county, province and national levels were under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA); the results were ultimately passed back to MAF for publication. Provincial governors were appointed by the President and in turn appointed the county chiefs, all under the administration of MHA. Production targets by crop flowed down from Seoul through the provincial governors to the county chiefs, and the results from the MAF field enumerators flowed up through the same channels. The conduct was that since neither the county chiefs nor the provincial governors were going to report themselves as failures, the production always met or exceeded
targets. The result, the performance, was that the production statistics were systematically biased upwards.
The structure of the delivery system was changed in the late 1970s by cutting MHA out of the channel and making MAF responsible for the data aggregations all the way from the field enumerators to the national level. This, of course, created a break in the statistics that was going to be a political problem for the Minister unless explained away. The solution was to announce that a new conceptual base and methodology was being introduced into the MAF statistical collection activity that would result in lower production figures. Historical data were adjusted to take out the systematic bias and to create a consistent historical time series.
In retrospect, the conduct of the parties involved and the resulting performance could have been anticipated, given the structure of the statistical collection system. In our framework, the failure to achieve effective performance arose because of de facto unenforceability: the informal rules were such that the political and agricultural statistics functions were not separable in that structure. There might still be sources of systematic bias in the system, but at least an important and obvious one was removed. These authors will never know the content of the discussions that had to have taken place within the President's cabinet that resulted in the decision to allow the MAP statistics bureau chief to implement the change in the system. Presumably, since Korea was approximately self-sufficient in rice, the most political of the grains, by the mid-1970s when the change took place targets were no longer important.
Example 2. Agricultural Input Supply in the Republic of Korea (K2.eg)
In the 1970s, the South Korean National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF), a parastatal farmer cooperative operating under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) was responsible for, inter alia, delivery of fertilizer, chemicals and seed to Korean farmers. It became evident that a "grey market" was operating, particularly in fertilizer, in the countryside, with some farmers purchasing more fertilizer than their needs from NACF and reselling to neighbouring farmers. Outward appearances could not explain the presence of the grey market, since all farmers were members of the local cooperative and should have had equal access.
Further, NACF had a network of "extension" workers operating at local level, purportedly providing advice and technical information to farmers. This seemed curious since MAF operated a national extension service with local offices that appeared to be quite good, reliable, and much used by local farmers. NACF, unlike farmer cooperatives as we know them in the western world, was controlled by the government with government-appointed officers throughout. Further investigation revealed that NACF, through the network of "extension" workers, was the ruling party's ward system in rural
Korea. The "extension" workers were there to make sure that the Korean farmers thought and voted "correctly". If they did not, the sanction by the "extension" worker was to withhold inputs, mainly fertilizer. Hence the fertilizer grey market.
The policy was to make modem inputs available to farmers and to use NACF to do so. The structure was a cooperative system controlled by MAF that indeed worked well in making inputs available in plentiful quantities and at reasonable cost through the local cooperative outlets. But control of the cooperative system by MAF allowed control through the Ministry by the President's office for political purposes. The conduct was to use the NACF for political purposes by withholding fertilizer from farmers who were not politically correct. The performance was that inputs were not distributed in an equitable way to all farmers, which resulted in a grey market. The system was effective, efficient and enforceable for political purposes; it was neither effective nor equitable for agricultural production purposes.
In the early 1990s, farmers were allowed to elect their national and local cooperative leaders. To what extent this has broken the hold of the ruling party on the organization is not known to these authors, but we expect that it is at least weakened.
Example 3. Marketing of Export Crops in Sierra Leone^15 (SL.eg)
(^15 This example is based on the work of one of the authors, published in MAFF/FAO 1992.)
The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board (SLPMB) was established after WWII with the intention of securing the most favourable arrangements for the producers of export crops, and was made the monopsony purchaser (through its buying agents) and monopoly exporter of cocoa, coffee, palm kernel, and other export crops. During the first half of the 1980s, its purchases of cocoa, coffee and oil palm were quite buoyant, but they declined rapidly from the mid-1980s. The peak of SLPMB's cocoa and coffee purchases was reached in 1984/85 (11 000 tonnes and 10 000 tonnes, respectively). By 1988/89, these figures had dropped to 5 000 tonnes and under 3 000 tonnes, with no reduction in the area under cultivation. In other words, even if productivity had fallen, that could not explain the fall in purchases. In 1991, SLPMB's monopsony powers were taken away (although it still then retained the export monopoly), and the domestic market was opened up to private traders. At the same time, the
government introduced a minimum producer price of 60 percent of f.o.b. world market price. Official coffee and cocoa exports leapt up to a total of 23 000 tonnes in 1990/91, with SLPMB purchasing 36 percent of domestic production.
Over the years, SLPMB had expanded its range of activities into oil palm plantation ownership and palm kernel processing (and other upstream processing), and had in 1979 been landed with the responsibility for taking over the operations of the Rice Corporation in both domestic purchases and rice importation. This led to financial and management problems, exacerbated by politicization of the institution and diversion of funds for Treasury and private gain. Serving the interests of export-crop producers ceased to figure high on its agenda.
In consequence, SLPMB lost its effective monopsony in the mid-1980s. Export crops were being taxed at a rate of about 30 percent, and the average producer price paid by SLPMB was less than 50 percent of f.o.b. world market price. Although the Leone underwent a series of massive devaluations that should have increased the incentives to producers of export commodities, inflation was running at very high levels and the Leone was not convertible. Further, while the world prices of coffee and cocoa have been falling over time in real terms, they have fluctuated substantially in the short run in nominal terms. Sierra Leonean producers had an alternative to SLPMB and the vagaries of their own macroeconomy in their historic cross-border trading links with Liberia, whose currency was tied to the US dollar. The loss of this market opportunity because of the Liberian civil war and consequent currency turmoil coincided with the liberalization of domestic marketing in Sierra Leone. The
competitors to SLPMB offered a better service to farmers through price premiums and a pre-financing system, and a barter system to provide essential consumer goods (including rice, which, in Sierra Leone, acts as an inflation-proof form of cash) in exchange for produce.
This example is particularly interesting because the main institutional player in the policy delivery system, SLPMB, was also supposed to be the generator of the policy benefits. Through its buying and selling operations, it was supposed to be able to use its monopsonistic and monopolistic powers to benefit the small-scale producers (and all coffee and cocoa production in Sierra Leone is in the hands of small-scale producers - there was never any plantation production of those crops) by reducing their marketing costs and negotiating a better international price for their exports. As indicated, the structure consisted of SLPMB with monopsony/monopoly powers in the export crop market, and no farmer control of the organization's operations. Conduct shows a combination of circumstances: acquisition of extraneous enterprises, mismanagement, diversion of funds to private interests, a volatile domestic macroeco-nomy and a ready hard currency market in neighbouring countries (not
all of which are depicted in the flow chart) allowed producers to develop a lucrative cross-border black market. This further depressed the price offered to producers and exacerbated the decline of SLPMB to the point that in terms of performance its effectiveness in accomplishing the original policy objective could only be judged as dismal. The mismanagement and appropriation of funds for private gain destroyed its operational efficiency. The rules against the black market were unenforceable since the alternative hard currency market and higher prices across the border was irresistible, i.e., the system was unenforceable in principle because of mass disobedience with respect to the formal rules. Any serious attempt at enforcement would have been extremely costly because of the lengthy land border and difficult terrain, and the benefits of enforcement would not have accrued to those bearing the costs. In other words, far from generating policy benefits, SLPMB successfully
generated policy disbenefits.
The solution in this case was to abandon the policy, open the domestic market to private traders and establish a minimum producer price of 60 percent of the f.o.b. export price, enforceable through SLPMB. This, coupled with the war across the border, eliminated the black market and reinstated SLPMB as the monopoly exporter of Sierra Leone export production.
With regard to equity, under the original structure all producers were treated equally badly.
