FOREWORD
Throughout history, policy, including agricultural policy of interest here, has been influenced by a society's values relating to concepts and perceptions of agriculture, nature, equity, and the associated beliefs about the rights or wrongs of the situation. The way in which "values and beliefs" influence the political debate and its outcome becomes possibly more apparent when societies with different histories and cultures, and therefore differing values and beliefs, are brought together for instance on the occasion of discussions aimed at the grouping of countries into regional blocs for economic or political reasons. Beyond the well documented economic and strategic interests of the potential partners, such divergences often underlie the varied country positions taken during the negotiations of the terms of the regional grouping, and unrecognized or unacknowledged differences in values and beliefs can lead to additional complexities in reaching an agreement and later
implementing it. This has been the case for instance in western Europe as the original six countries negotiated the Treaty of Rome to form the then EEC, and in each successive round of accessions (or refusals) since. It was true as first the Canada-US free trade agreement was negotiated and later when NAFTA added Mexico. And it will be true as NAFTA expands throughout the Americas and as APEC becomes a reality.
To assess the importance of values and beliefs in the formulation and implementation of policy, notably policy related to agriculture, FAO decided to take a closer look at how that process unfolds, with a view to making the policy negotiating process - international in this case, but more generally domestic as well - more transparent and, it is therefore to be hoped, easier and more understandable for those involved. This study takes as example the contemplated eastern enlargement of the EU to include some of the former centrally planned economies of central and eastern Europe (CEE). It is a case of particular complexity as the CEE countries are themselves each involved in an internal questioning of their values and beliefs, as they face the new challenges of the market economy.
Those directly involved in the analysis of western and eastern Europe developments should find this study of great interest. But it should also appeal to a much wider audience, either in relation with countries around the world where the issue of entering in supranational economic or political grouping with effect on agricultural and rural policy is relevant, or more generally in relation with the domestic debates. Indeed, the study also points up the importance of local divergences within countries. Thus I commend this study to all those interested in additional insights into the complex set of factors that influence the political debate behind agricultural and rural development.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
Looking for barriers
Looking for barriers
by Kate Hathaway and Dale Hathaway
This book explores the potential conflicts in one area of economic policy as the European Union enlarges to include countries of Central Europe that were from World War II until the 1990s a part of the communist bloc and governed by communist parties. The area of policy concern is agricultural policy, which for the countries in the European Union has been one of the most cohesive community-wide policies and is often referred to as the glue that holds the European Union together.
Beliefs and values
The approach used to examine the possible conflicts is to examine the beliefs and values held by policy leaders in Western Europe and in Central Europe on a series of issues considered to be basic to food, agricultural, and rural policies. The examination took place in a series of papers and commentaries on basic policy issues prepared by a group of distinguished scholars and policy makers from Western and Central Europe. The authors of these papers and commentaries then participated in a five day seminar in which the concepts and issues were examined in depth with special attention to how the beliefs and values differed or were similar from country to country.
In the context of this discussion a belief is defined as how persons think things are and a value is defined as how persons think things ought to be. Put differently, a belief is a perception of current reality and a value is a perception of how one would prefer current reality to be. The starting point of this examination of polices is the assertion that beliefs and values count in the process of building and maintaining functional policies. More will be said on the subject of how they count later in this chapter. It also was assumed that more than forty years of communist control of the countries of Central Europe had a profound impact on the beliefs and values of the people in those countries regarding food and agriculture. If so, these differences will lead to different policy pressures from those in Western Europe with its markedly different history.
Some persons argue that differences over agricultural policy are irrelevant insofar as enlargement of the EU is concerned to include countries of Central Europe. They assert that the overwhelming desire of the Central European countries to achieve the economic and political protection that membership in the EU affords is so great that they will accept whatever agricultural policies the EU demands for entry. This may be true, but it is not the end of the story. The modification of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to accommodate the addition of countries with large agricultural sectors and many farmers is a certainty that has already begun in thought if not in action. Furthermore, as the discussions of the CAP later in this book point out, it is not a static policy and it will have to continue to be adjusted after the entry of the new countries in Central Europe. And, unless the EU substantially alters its decision-making structure the recent entrants will also play a
significant role in determining future policies.
It should be noted that at least for the next quarter century the politicians and policy makers in Central European countries will be persons whose formative years were under the old communist systems. Thus, it seems important and useful to understand how those systems influenced the beliefs and values relating to a crucial policy area.
The role of beliefs and values in policy formation^1
^1 Much of the information in this section was taken from the original paper of Michel Petit as delivered at the Seminar on Beliefs and Values Underlying Agricultural Policies, Lake Balaton, Hungary, September 19-23, 1996.
In modem times, an early interpretation of the role of beliefs and values in government interventions was provided by one of the project leaders for this study, in his book published more than 30 years ago. ^2 "Our government policies in agriculture represent an attempt to achieve, via government, certain widely-shared aspirations or values in our society."...
^2 Dale E. Hathaway, Government and Agriculture - Public Policy in a Democratic Society, McMillan, New York. 1963.
"In order to understand fully the nature of the public policies, it is necessary to understand the ends that are sought via such actions or the aspirations that underlie them. This is particularly true in agricultural policy, for, as we shall see, these aspirations relate to fundamental issues regarding how society should be organized and the desirable relationships between men."
However, the author was ambiguous regarding how beliefs and values affect policies. The above quotation from his first chapter suggests that policies are indeed determined eventually by the maximisation of a social utility function. Yet, in the third part of the 1963 book, where the policy process is described and a model of policy behaviour is presented, the fact that different groups in society have different beliefs and values is explicitly recognised.
A discussion of political processes must contain some implicit model of political behaviour. The earlier discussion of values and beliefs has pointed out that various groups within and outside agriculture have sharply different beliefs and values regarding agriculture. The model of political behaviour used assumes that the primary function of the political process is the compromising of these conflicting or competing values and the discerning of the relevant beliefs in a fashion that maximizes the satisfaction of the relevant groups in society. Such a view of the political process is a rejection of the concept that it is essentially and largely a process which derives the 'national interest' or the 'public good.'
More recently, a group of American authors clearly inspired by Hathaway's concepts have produced an examination of current beliefs and values affecting agriculture in the US, entitled Sacred Cows and Hot Potatoes ^3. It is interesting that the central perspective of these authors, as revealed by their subtitle, is to debunk myths affecting the agricultural policy debate in the United States: thus their intention is clearly normative. They want to correct what they view as mistakes and to promote a change in policies consistent with these corrections and with what they assert to be traditional, fundamental values. But they do not clearly spell out how modem policies that could respect such traditional values, as well as presumably better perceptions of the facts, i.e., better beliefs, could be designed.
^3 W.P. Browne et al., Sacred Cows and Hot Potatoes - Agrarian Myths in Agricultural Policies, Westview Press, Boulder, 1992.
A very different approach stressing the positive analysis of why policies are and what they are is probably more useful. This approach is very much inspired by the new political economy of such authors as Downs, Buchanan, Kruger, Olson, Stigler, etc. This literature, of the late 1960s and mainly 1970s, was not available when the Hathaway book was written in the early 1960s, but he clearly was a precursor of the new political economy, as argued earlier. ^4 Many of the intuitions in the third part of his book on the policy process fit very well with the new political economy literature, which is based in particular on a model of policy behaviour which assumes that policy actors seek not the public good but then-own interests.
^4 M. Petit, "For an Analytical Political Economy: Relevance to the Study of Domestic and International Agricultural Trade Policies," Paper presented at the Theodor Heidhues Memorial Seminar, Gˆttingen, Federal Republic of Germany, 1980.
If, as suggested elsewhere, economic interests shaped by long-term economic forces, are the main determinant of policies, ^5 is there any role for beliefs and values in the policy making process? Obviously beliefs and values have an important role to play, but the mechanism and the specific details of how that role is being played remains to be specified. One interpretation is that beliefs and values play a role at two levels.
^5 M. Petit et al., Agricultural Policy Formation in the European Community: The Birth of Milk Quotas and Cap Reform, Developments in Agricultural Economics 4, Elsevier, 1987.
First, they contribute to shaping the groups which become policy actors. Individuals do not have enough weight in the policy making process. To be influential, collective action is needed, but collective action requires the existence of collective actors. Individual actors will tend to join groups or to form groups with other individuals having the same interests. However, economic interests are extremely varied and never completely homogeneous. As a result collective action is never straightforward. The conditions and pitfalls for such collective actions have been well studied by Olson (1965). People sharing broadly common interests tend to have similar beliefs and values, and they form collective actors. One can assume that these common beliefs and values are important too for the cohesion of the collective actors.
The second role of beliefs and values is related to the fact that in any policy making process all the actors do not play equal roles. In particular, one puzzle raised by agricultural policy in many OECD countries is that consumers and tax payers do not seem to exert the influence which their interest and numbers would warrant. A commonly accepted explanation for this paradox has to do with the cost of information. For individual consumers to get organized collectively and become influential would entail costs for getting informed, active and influential on agricultural policy issues, which are not warranted by the benefits they would gain. So even though consumers are more numerous than farmers, they do not exert a great weight. For farmers the reverse is true. Indeed they have formed powerful organizations, and they have much greater influence than consumers on agricultural policies in Western Europe, as well as in other OECD countries.
In this context, a plausible hypothesis for the role of beliefs and values could be that consumers and tax payers, often the same people, i.e., the public at large, will tolerate a sectoral policy which may not serve their best interest, if that policy is not in too sharp a contrast with what they believe to be the situation of farmers and what they value as fair for the place of farmers in society. For instance, there is little doubt that in the USA the idea that family farms need to be protected has played an important role in maintaining agricultural policies which did not serve the best interest of consumers and tax payers. Whether or not the adopted policies actually protect family farms was not relevant as long as they were perceived to do so better than possible alternative policies.
Similarly, in Western Europe, the ideas that farmers are hard working, that they have made valiant efforts for adapting to new techniques and that, even though they are hardworking, they are not very well paid, and therefore deserve a special treatment, is very widely held. This set of beliefs and values commonly held in the public at large, as demonstrated by repeated opinion polls, has presumably played an important role in explaining why the Common Agricultural Policy has been so much tilted in favour of farmers against the interests of consumers and tax payers. So in the context of a pluralist society, where policies are the result of an evolving debate among various groups, social beliefs and values play an important role in determining what will be acceptable by society at large.
Whatever the explanatory model one accepts eventually, everybody agrees that beliefs and values are important. There is also widespread agreement on the fact that those beliefs and values change through time and that it is important to take into account the historical process of policy formation and evolution if one wants to provide meaningful explanations and be able, on the basis of these explanations, to predict something about the future. This consensus thus justifies the outline for this paper.
In the chapters that follow it is clear that nearly half a century of communist political and economic organization have left an indelible mark on the beliefs and values of persons in Central Europe. These appear to show up most sharply in different views relating to the role of agriculture in the economy and society, views on desired economic structure, and the belief that trade policy should be an extension of domestic price and income policy. The countries of Central Europe appear to be searching for an income policy for farmers, and it appears uncertain whether income policies will take the same direction as they have in the EU. On the issues of rural environment there are similar values as to the desired objectives, but the political dynamics relating to environmental issues appear markedly different. Because of the decades of communist neglect of rural areas, the former communist countries appear to have a higher priority on rural development than some of the countries
in the EU. In the case of food safety there appears to be a universal sharing of the desire for safe food supplies, and Central European countries are keenly aware that in order to compete in the markets in Western Europe, their products must meet high quality standards.
This book is not an attempt to suggest how the integration of Central Europe into the EU will evolve. It does, however, look at the policies of a key sector and suggest where in one way or another political and economic adjustments may be required.

CHAPTER 2 THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMY
The role of agriculture in the economy and society1
The role of agriculture in the economy and society: Group discussion and a commentary
The role of agriculture in the economy and society1
by Rolf Moehler
^1 Paper presented at the Seminar on Beliefs and Values Underlying Agricultural Policies, Lake Balaton, Hungary, September 19-23, 1996.
The history of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) can be seen as the history of attempts to limit the cost of support. But the need for support has only been questioned recently. Not surprisingly, justifications change over time. But it would be wrong to see in agricultural support only the work of an influential political lobby. As the opinion poll of Eurobarometer in 1988 has shown the population at large in the European Community is in its majority prepared to reserve a particular treatment to agriculture. As long as the cost of this policy appears to be manageable, the public is prepared to see agriculture not as an economic activity like many others.
The CAP has even an added value for European integration. The CAP has played a crucial role in European integration from the very beginning. As the CAP is intervening in the markets, it had an integrating effect which has gone much beyond agriculture. The market organizations created under the CAP were not only the first regulations of the Community with legally binding effect on the citizens of the member states, they gave also the European Commission wide-ranging responsibilities in managing the policy. Thus, the CAP became the blue-print for the way European integration works. Its techniques have been applied in many other areas of Community policy.
The following text tries to trace the values which are attached to agriculture from the beginning of the CAP until today. Against this background an attempt is made to assess the situation in the CEFTA countries (Poland, Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, Slovenia) too.
The changing role of agriculture in the economy
To illustrate the changes agriculture has undergone two sets of figures may be useful. The Stresa Conference in 1958 worked on the basis that employment in agriculture on average in the six original member states was 25 percent, whereas its contribution to GDP did not go beyond 14 percent. The respective figures for the Community of 15 in 1994 are 5.7 percent and 2.5 percent. A fraction of the workforce in the 1950s is now producing a much higher quantity of food. It is well known that this is due to technical progress through mechanisation, better seed and breeding qualities, better resource management etc. It is, however, surprising to note that this tremendous technical and economic development has certainly led to a change in values considered important, but not to a reversal of attitude towards agriculture.
The early days of the CAP
Already the report submitted by the heads of delegations to the six Foreign Ministers in April 1956, the so-called Spaak-Report, suggested a special treatment for agriculture. The reasons were the particular social structure around the family farm, the volatility of production, low elasticity of demand and differences in yields, input-prices and revenues between the different regions.
The five objectives of the CAP as laid down in Article 39 of the Rome Treaty^2 deal with the farmer and the consumer i.e., the society at large. The farmer is expected to increase his productivity and thus his standard of living, whereas the consumer can rely on sufficient supplies at reasonable prices. Stability of the market is thought to benefit both, the producer and the consumer.
^2 European Union, selected instruments taken from the Treaties, Book 1, Volume 1, published by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg, 1995, p. 151.
These objectives are broad enough to cover a more market oriented as well as a more interventionist policy. Therefore, Article 39 in its second paragraph gives some references for the elaboration of a common agricultural policy. The particular nature of agricultural activity which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions should be taken into account. However, the text does not forget to mention that agriculture "constitutes a sector closely linked with the economy as a whole." ^3 In Article 40 the Treaty rules out any discrimination among farmers or consumers within the Community. Although this does not preclude treating farmers in different situations differently, the provision lent support to the belief that the farming community is a homogeneous group of mainly family farmers.
^3 Ibid.
It is interesting to note that the 'specificity' of agriculture which played such a central role in the development of the CAP is not linked to climatic factors but to the place of agriculture in society and to regional disparities.
At the Stresa-Conference^5 in 1958, which laid the basis for the development of the CAP, Ministers of the six original member states stressed the importance of the fanning population for social stability. The family farm was recognised unanimously as the way to provide this stability. Mr. Houdet, the then French Minister was the most outspoken when he said that the State has to ensure that all farmers enjoy the appropriate income and their proper place in the economy and in society. The then-Commission President Walter Hallstein mentioned independence and freedom based on the ownership of his farm as the particular virtues of the European farmer. Judging from the speeches made and the reports submitted, employment in agriculture was not a major concern.
^5 Dokumente der Landwirtschaftskonferenz der Mitgliedstaaten der Europaischen Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft in Stres vom 3. bis 12. Juli 1958, published by Publication Service of the European Communities. Luxembourg 1959 (document 2116/1/59/5).
It was widely recognised that increase of productivity would lead to a diminishing workforce in agriculture. Depopulation of rural areas in France was mentioned, but not by the French Minister. Nobody, except the Belgian representative, mentioned the most basic task of the farmer, i.e., providing food for society. This, however, should not mislead us. It was not mentioned because it was so self-evident.
In post-war Europe the awareness that farmers produce an essential ingredient of life, namely food, was very strong. Despite industrialisation and urbanisation in Europe since the middle of the last century, the feeling that farmers had a special role in society as providers of food was wide-spread before the Second World War. The scarcity of supplies during the war could only enhance this feeling.
But there was even more to it. Rural life and thus the farmer had a symbolic value for all those who felt uncomfortable with or hostile to modernisation of society triggered by industrialisation and urbanisation. This is a recurrent feature of European civilisation which can already be found during the Roman Empire.
Summing up there were mainly three reasons justifying a specific appreciation of agricultural activity:
∑ the farmer is producing the most basic goods for human livelihood;
∑ the farmer is providing social stability through his hard work and the particular structure of the rural society;
∑ the farmer is, in his production, subject to the volatility of weather conditions.
The Community dimension added a fourth reason which became very powerful over time:
∑ the regional disparities which the Community was supposed to overcome.
These four aspects and the ingredient of cultural nostalgia ensured a particular place for the farmer in society. As the farmer is ensuring the livelihood of society, society has to ensure the farmer's livelihood. In addition he was still representing the good old times, when European countries were basically rural societies.
In such a specific relationship between farmer and society economic efficiency is not the overwhelming consideration for agricultural policy although it is present in Article 39 of the Treaty, which sees increasing productivity as the main vehicle for growth of income.
The implementation of the objectives of the CAP
Title II of the Treaty on the European Community does not rule out the option of meeting the objectives and other requirements of Article 39 by a mere co-ordination of agricultural policies pursued by the member states. This reflects the variety of support systems which existed in the 1950s in the different member states. But soon it became obvious that a common market for agricultural products could not function without a common policy. In order to enable free circulation of agricultural product, the support system had to be a uniform Community wide system. It was logical to finance such a system from Community and not member states resources and to establish a common import regime which in any case was called for by the requirements of a common commercial policy. In such a way the three fundamental principles of the CAP came to life: the common market, financial solidarity and Community preference.
The market organizations for all main production sectors which were created during the first 10 years of Community existence were, not surprisingly, biased towards stabilising markets and increasing the income of farmers which did not flow exclusively from increase of productivity. The consumer had to pay higher prices than world market prices, but he did not complain very much. In some member states prices even fell in comparison with the situation before the market organizations came into effect (e.g., for cereals in Germany). But the prices of food-stuff became less and less relevant when the general income level increased and the share of food in household expenditure diminished. At the same time the offer of food in terms of variety of products and quality improved considerably.
Despite relatively high market prices the traditional structures changed. Employment in agriculture fell with increasing mechanisation and the average size of exploitations increased. But this did not affect the essence of the traditional family farm.
The family farm can be small or big, as long as it provides the livelihood for a family. But a farm will not provide the livelihood for the family if it is not a profitable undertaking. The term 'family farm' implies, however, that the farm is more than an opportunity to make money. The added value is the attachment to the traditional values: attachment to the land, keeping the farm in the family for generations, active involvement of the farmer and his family in the running of the farm. In the Community of six member states there were not many which could not be considered as family farms because the owners lived elsewhere. There were, of course, considerable differences in the size of the exploitations. But in all the six member states the relatively small family farm was predominant. This did not change fundamentally with the enlargements in 1973, 1981 and 1986. Membership of Britain increased the number of large holdings but this was somewhat counterbalanced by the
rather small Greek and Portuguese farms, Denmark, Spain and Ireland being in the middle.
The family farm as the main type of Community farming and the flexibility this concept allowed, made it possible to treat farmers in the same way irrespective of differences in the size of the exploitation and income, in climatic conditions, etc. A notable exception was the additional support which farmers in mountainous and less favoured areas received.
From hindsight the 1960s were a good time for the CAP when most of the market organizations were completed, had there not been the Mansholt Plan^8. In its Memorandum on the Reform of Agriculture in the European Economic Community of December 1968, the Commission sought to deal with two problems which had arisen: emerging surpluses and the falling back of income growth in agriculture compared with the rest of the economy. The Memorandum talks about an explosive situation. It fears that the surpluses will undermine support for agriculture in society and that the growing disparity between farm and non-farm income will erode the contribution of agriculture to social stability. Unfortunately, the Memorandum with its proposals for reduction of arable areas and cow herds triggered the explosion: a very hostile reaction of the farming community. Not all was lost, however: The Mansholt Plan was the beginning of a structural policy on the Community level.
^8 Memorandum sur la reforme de l'agriculture dans la Communaute Europeene, Communication de la Commission des Communautes EuropÈennes, document COM (68) 1000, Brussels 1968.
The watershed of the 1980s
Even without a Mansholt Plan Community agriculture was moving in the direction the plan had indicated, but much more slowly, of course. Going slow was possible because the British market opened up in 1973. Furthermore, the first oil-shock in 1972 increased world wide demand for agricultural products. But things were changing at the beginning of the 1980s and public perception of agriculture, too.
The second oil shock and the resulting world recession in 1979 made the bell ring for agriculture in the European Community. Ever increasing production which was met with shrinking demand led to huge stocks. These stocks could only be kept and disposed of with high costs. Around 70 percent of the Community budget went into agricultural support. Newspapers started to write about butter and beef mountains and wine lakes. The impression that something was wrong with the CAP spread.
Agriculture also came under attack because of its negative impact on the environment due to the application of pesticides and fertilisers. Sympathy for farmers did not evaporate and the perception that the farmer was entitled to support did not wane. But support was more and more considered excessive and the budgetary implications unbearable.
This shift in public attitude led to a number of measures to redress the situation in the 1980s, including the establishment of milk quotas in 1984 and the stabilisation measures in 1988. The basic problems, however, were only addressed in the reform of 1992 which allowed the completion of the Uruguay Round Trade Negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the end of 1993. During the GATT-negotiations agriculture came for the. first time under massive pressure from industry to reform the CAP. As a satisfactory result for agriculture was a pre-condition for an overall deal, agriculture had to move. This does not mean that the 1992 reform was triggered only by the Uruguay Round, but it put additional pressure on agriculture to accept the reform of the CAP. At the same time, farmers realised that they had to respond to the increasing concern about the environment if they wanted to see continuing support by society. They also felt the need to respond
to the increasing concern of consumers about the quality and safety of food.
This development is reflected in the initiatives the Commission took in order to reform the CAP. The Reflection Paper^9 which the Commission published in December 1980 follows still traditional thinking. It cites among the positive aspects the consumer's security of supply at stable prices, the progress in agricultural techniques and the contribution of agricultural exports to the balance of trade. But it is worried about the budgetary consequences of production surpluses and regional disparities in benefits derived from the CAP.
^9 Reflexions sur la politique agricole commune, Communication de la Commission au Conseil, Bulletin des Communautes Europeennes, Supplement 6/80, Office des publications officielles des Communautes Europeennes, Luxembourg, 1981.
The Green Book of 1985^10 on Perspectives for the CAP tries a new approach. It seeks to limit production increases by adjusting the mechanisms of the CAP without questioning the need for support. The Green Book still mentions food security as an important asset of the CAP but it puts less emphasis on the claim that agriculture is an essential element of social stability in general, it focuses instead on the social stability of rural areas. The attitude towards the protection of the environment is somewhat ambiguous reflecting changes of perception. The Green Book stresses the crucial role of agriculture for preserving the natural landscape and the environment but at the same time calls upon farmers to pay more attention to the environment. For the first time the perspective of agriculture providing raw materials for industry is set out in detail. On labour the Green Book wants to keep a substantial part of the workforce in agriculture, but it also recognises the need for
increasing productivity further.

The systematic promotion of rural development on Community level has been one of the achievements of the reform launched in 1985. Since the reform of the so-called structural funds (regional fund, social fund, agricultural guidance fund) in 1988, the promotion of rural development is one of the objectives of structural policy (the so-called 5b programme^11). Further restructuring of Community agriculture will inevitably lead to a loss of population in rural areas. This may lead in certain regions to such a low level of population density that essential infrastructure and services cannot be maintained, resulting in the need to address this problem by strengthening rural development. In this context, it is recognised that agricultural activity is essential but not sufficient to keep rural areas economically viable.

The Basic Paper on the Future Development of the CAP, ^12 which the Commission submitted in February 1991 and which was the basis for the 1992 Reform, confirmed the role of agriculture in society as defined in 1985. But it pursued a new approach in order to tackle the surplus problem. It put an end to unlimited support for unlimited quantities of production in the cereal, oilseeds and beef sectors. Intervention prices were reduced and farmers were compensated for the income loss by direct payments linked to past production. In order to control supply, direct payment for cereal and oilseeds areas were made subject to set-aside requirements or limited to 90 animals per farm, and a stocking ratio of 2.5 livestock units per hectare in the beef sector.

The Eurobarometer of 1988
These developments were supported by public opinion. In 1987, the European Commission within its public opinion poll scheme conducted a survey on the attitude of the citizens of the Community towards agriculture which was published in 1988. One of the main results was that a majority of the population in each member state wanted the public authorities to support agriculture and felt that agricultural expenditure was not too high. The main reason given was the contribution of agriculture to the protection of the environment and to the preservation of the countryside. It was felt that the CAP prevents whole regions of Europe from becoming depopulated and deserted.
Strong support was expressed for healthier food. The majority in most member states supported production for non-food use. But it also became clear that the majority did not like surplus production and felt that support should go only to those who need it.
The perspective of the 1990s
It is fair to assume that depending on overall growth the share of agriculture in GDP will further shrink. The same will happen with employment in agriculture. But these parameters are already fallacious when assessing the weight of agriculture in the economy, and even less so in society.
In economic terms, the impact of agriculture is much larger than the share in GDP suggests if one includes the up-stream and down-stream sectors. In society at large support for agriculture is still not challenged in principle as long as expenditure is kept under control and surplus production can be avoided. In his Agricultural Report 1996,^13 published in April, the German Federal Minister of Agriculture cites secure supply of high-quality food-stuffs and renewable resources, environmental conservation, animal welfare, a well-tended landscape and pretty villages as the main reasons that society should support agriculture. By the same token, he stresses the need for agriculture to be not only "environmentally friendly" but also "efficient, competitive, market oriented." His colleagues in the Council of Ministers would broadly agree with this statement, with the exception perhaps of the British and Swedish Minister. But even the British and Swedish Farmers' Union would be
able to subscribe to the German Ministers statement. When comparing the statement with the situation in the 1950s and 1960s similarities and differences appear.

Food security has a different meaning. The European Community is a leading agricultural producer, exporter and importer. The negotiations of the Uruguay Round have brought home to a wider public that food security of the EC would not be at risk if it produced less. Therefore, the emphasis is shifting to the quality of food-stuff although the value added by high quality is in many cases not the work of the farmer. Under these circumstances the role of agriculture in maintaining the environment and providing the basis for rural development becomes more important.
Historically speaking, agriculture's role in the protection of the environment is ambiguous. Agriculture has been preserving and polluting the environment. Concern about the environment was already in people's minds before 1992, but the reform tried a new and more systematic approach in three ways:
∑ the reduction in price support was to be an incentive to more extensive farming by making massive use of inputs less profitable;
∑ the set-aside requirement for crops and the stocking ratio for bovine animals should enhance the favourable impact on the environment;
∑ a programme authorising payments for specific measures favourable to the environment.
But the new approach goes further than a mere prevention of pollution. European landscape is the result of centuries of human endeavour, not the least of the work by farmers. Thus, by cultivating the land, the farmer becomes the steward of the landscape in the European Union. In promoting and supporting this activity, the CAP responds to the expectations of the public at large.
But the farmer cannot preserve the landscape when rural areas are deserted. In the 1960s and 1970s the reduction of the number of people employed in agriculture was widely accepted as the inevitable consequence of higher productivity and higher income for those remaining in agriculture. It was only in 1988, when reform of the CAP was tried by means of so-called stabilisers, that the ensuing problem for the rural areas which may become deserted was clearly recognised. The 1992 reform gave a new push. Budgetary outlets for the promotion of rural development were increased. They are at the order of 1 billion Ecu/year now. A new programme 'Leader' was launched, which builds on local initiatives. It covers all areas, not only agricultural ones, but is particularly strong in agricultural areas.
Interestingly, the German Minister of Agriculture also mentions supply of renewable resources and animal welfare as contributions by agriculture which justify a special treatment.^14 Both are in a wider sense related to the protection of the environment. Production of renewable resources helps to slow down the depletion of non-renewable resources. The reference to animal welfare tries to distinguish the German farmer from so-called 'industrial' methods as applied in feed-lots or 'egg-factories'. Animal welfare is, however, not a major concern in all the member states. Therefore, I doubt that it is an argument which can be used in all of the Community.

Further adjustments ahead?
Despite the 1992 CAP reform and its emphasis on a more market oriented approach to agricultural support, fanning is still not considered a normal commercial activity. This assessment is likely to change at least for those farms which are commercially viable and shed the mantle of the family farm. The fact mat there are commercially viable farms in most member states which could compete under world market conditions is not common knowledge. But this is likely to change, mainly for two reasons:
∑ After the 1992 reform the budget transfers are much more visible and are substantial for farms with large crop areas. The sums involved will raise questions about their justification, in particular for big farms.
∑ Many East German exploitations which have been created after the down-fall of communism have a chance to become commercially profitable enterprises. These are large farms, specialising in crops with 1,000 to 3,000 hectares. It is significant that many of these exploitations are set up as incorporated companies. According to the Agricultural Report 1996 of the German government the average size is 1.721 ha and they cover 60 percent of the agricultural area and 80 percent of the herds in the new Bundesl‰nder. It is interesting to note in this context that the Minister for Agriculture of Saxony, which is part of Eastern Germany, pleaded on January 9, 1997 for a reduction of market price support, for the elimination of supply control measures and for increased exports. This is not the view held by the Federal Government in Germany.
Since the public realises that there is a dichotomy between a commercially viable sector and the less competitive farms, support will not disappear, but it is likely to be more focused on the weaker part of the agricultural population as the Eurobarometer of 1988 has already indicated. With a commercially viable fanning sector becoming more visible, the attitude of the public to agriculture is bound to change at least towards this part of Community agriculture.
In its agricultural strategy paper on further enlargement of the European Union in December 1995, the Commission have come to the conclusion that a continuation of the 1992 reform is inevitable. This conclusion is not so much motivated by the perspective of future membership of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries but by the dynamics of CAP and of Community agriculture. The results of the Uruguay Round will lead Community agriculture into an impasse if it does not become more competitive; i.e., be able to export without export subsidies. It is by no means sure that the competitive farmers will no longer use the weaker ones as justification for support which benefits all, but the chances that the CAP will rather differentiate in the future have never been better.
The situation in the Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA) countries
Ten countries of Central and Eastern Europe have applied for membership to the European Union: the five CEFTA-countries (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Slovenia), Romania, Bulgaria and the three Baltic states. For the purpose of this paper it appears preferable to focus on the CEFTA-countries, which show a certain similarity as far as the starting point of transition and the achievements of reform are concerned. Two of the Balkan States, Romania and Bulgaria, although keen to carry forward the transition process, are in a somewhat different situation.
In the CEFTA countries the share of agriculture in GDP is not particularly high, varying between 6.4 percent for Hungary and 3.3 percent for the Czech Republic, with an average of 5.5 percent. The share of employment in agriculture is relatively high with the exception of the Czech and Slovak Republics. For Poland the figure is above 25 percent, for Hungary and Slovenia above 10 percent. The share of food in household expenditure is relatively high in all the five countries. It is still too early for an assessment of the structure of agriculture which will emerge from privatisation. In Poland and Slovenia a significant part of small private holdings have survived communism. Privatisation of land has made considerable progress in all of these countries. The emergence of a dichotomy between small farms and large farms is already obvious in Poland, and similar developments can be seen in other CEFTA countries, too. This suggests that in all these countries, after overcoming the
difficulties of transition, at least part of the agricultural sector could be commercially viable.
Of course, this does not depend on the size of the farm only. Access to advanced technology, rural credit, management capabilities and a market oriented environment will also be crucial. For example, in the down-stream sector despite privatisation oligopolistic structures are still a problem.
There are two obstacles to grant or to increase support for agriculture: the relatively high share of food in household expenditure and budgetary constraints. Despite these powerful brakes support is increasing. The latest report of the OECD shows that in particular Hungary and Poland have increased support in PSE terms and that the Czech Republic is already at that level. Comparison of agricultural price levels in these countries with the price levels in the EC show that these prices are much closer to the EC level than the general income level. Whereas prices for main commodities in 1994 in these countries were roughly between 70 percent and 50 percent of the EC level, the wage level was only 20 percent of the EC, and GDP per capita on a purchasing power parity basis around one third of the EC level. Slovenia has even higher prices than the EC.
The attractiveness of the CAP is not sufficient to explain these phenomena. It is not only the political pressure by parties under the influence of fanning interests. It is, as well, the acceptance by society that farming deserves particular treatment.
What is the 'added value' of agriculture which justifies this treatment? The importance of agriculture for food security is a traditional feature of agriculture's appreciation in society. COMECON was certainly not well suited to put this image of agriculture into question. Food self-sufficiency was an official objective of government policies during that period. The positive contribution of agriculture to the trade balance is for the countries concerned certainly a more rational way to approach the matter of food security. Given the relatively high level of unemployment in most of the CEFTA-countries, there is concern that restructuring of agriculture may aggravate the employment situation. Thus, the situation in CEFTA-countries is similar to the situation in the European Community in the 1950s and 1960s but for the employment situation. Rural development appears to be seen mainly under the employment aspect whereas the positive role of agriculture for the protection of the
environment is hardly perceived. The farming population is seen as a stable part of society, in particular, where the part of employment in agriculture is still high.
Conclusions
What beliefs and values does the evolution of the CAP reflect ?
Over the last forty years five main beliefs, each attaching a specific value to agricultural activity, have shaped the CAP:
∑ the basic conviction that agriculture is essential to provide food security;
∑ the belief that agriculture has a specific contribution to make to the stability of society;
∑ the awareness that landscape in Europe is to a large extent the result of farmers' work over centuries;
∑ the recognition that agriculture is crucial for the preservation of the environment;
∑ the belief that the farming community is a homogeneous group, mainly composed of family farmers.
From the outset the CAP was, if not conceived, certainly implemented in such a way that it stimulated production and increased the income of farmers by means of higher production and prices. Thus it reflected a widespread belief in society that agriculture had to provide food security and social stability. When the CAP started, food scarcity during the war and the post-war period was still a vivid memory, and the ordeal of dictatorship and war had sharpened the desire for social stability. Of course, since the 1950s there was never any threat to food security in Western Europe. But there was a deep seated concern about food security and the oilseeds embargo applied by the US in 1972 did nothing to alleviate it. Only the surplus production of the 1980s dealt a severe blow to the idea that the CAP was essential to guarantee food security. Increasing and massive exports had no obvious link to food security in Europe either. The feeling that food security was perhaps less
pressing when the self sufficiency ratio for all the basic products was above 100 grew. It also became obvious that this way of ensuring food security was very costly, indeed. But this does not mean that the concern for food security has become obsolete. European farmers will have to feed the European Union citizens in the future, and there is concern about global food security. But, food security is no longer the shining Grail to which people pay tribute.
The early CAP reflected the concern for social stability, too. Farmers had been traditionally conservative and were considered to be a pillar of societal stability. The CAP responded by providing a framework for agricultural activity and a price level above world market prices, which ought to ensure a fair standard of living in accordance with the objectives of the CAP as laid down in Article 39 of the Treaty. Over time, market price support was supplemented by support for structural improvements and for mountainous and less-favoured areas. In the 1950s the share of persons employed in agriculture in the original six member states of the European Community was rather high, on average higher than today in most of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe wanting to join the EU. Therefore, a stable farming community was an essential factor of social stability. But the contribution of the farming community to social stability diminished over time with a decreasing number of
farmers. Farmers, at least in continental Europe, are still an important factor for rural areas and rural societies, but their role in society as a whole recedes.
The CAP-reforms of 1988 and 1992 reflect a shift of beliefs away from food security and social stability as agriculture's main service to society towards the value of agriculture in preserving the landscape and the environment. The reformed CAP makes support dependent on supply control in various ways, hardly a sign for concern about food security. Support price reductions are still compensated by direct payments. But as time goes by, these direct payments may be considered as an income support which will come under scrutiny, in particular in time of sluggish growth. Farmers will have to compete with other sectors of society for scarce budget resources. In such a debate their contribution to social stability will carry less weight than in the past. Will the new beliefs that agriculture is essential to preserve the countryside and the environment protect the direct payments?
Europeans were always attached to their countryside. Despite the attractions of urban life the negative side of urbanisation, like noise, air pollution, traffic congestion, has even reinforced this attachment. There was also never any doubt that Europe was largely shaped by the work of European farmers. There is a new growing awareness that this countryside may be in danger when agriculture recedes further. This puts agriculture in the position of providing a 'public good'. It may be questioned whether agriculture is indispensable for preserving the European landscape. Keeping the countryside could be the work of specialised companies which are not interested in agricultural production. But that is not accepted, neither by farmers nor by the public at large. To the contrary, as farming alone under modem conditions can no longer keep rural societies alive, support for non-agricultural activities is increasingly being granted under programmes for the development of rural
areas. However, the role of the farmer as the steward of the countryside is likely to weaken further the case for production and price support.
It may appear somewhat surprising that European agriculture has managed to jump on the band-wagon called 'protection of the environment'. For a long time agriculture has been perceived as a threat to environment, particularly under the CAP. The high support level was considered as an incentive to intensive agriculture. Today the CAP is promoting extensive agriculture by methods reducing or eliminating the negative impact of agricultural activity. Thus the support provided enables agriculture in the European Union to qualify as protector of the environment. An even stronger contribution to the preservation of the environment is the production of renewable resources which would replace unrenewable resources as is the case when biomass replaces petrol. The shift in beliefs, however, will have its impact on the kind of support if not on its size. The more an environmental value is attached to agriculture, the more extensive forms of agriculture will be favoured and supported.
This again is likely to weaken further the case for production support.
An issue which is stirring up a lot of controversy is differentiation among farmers. The debate started because of the question of how additional direct payments to compensate for further price cuts can be financed under existing budget guidelines. But the debate has a wider perspective: it is linked to the question whether farmers of future member states from Central and Eastern Europe should benefit from direct payments which were the result of prior reductions these farmers have never seen. The CAP does not differentiate much between farmers or regions. It is obvious that in a single market price support has to be uniform across the Union. As direct payments introduced by the 1992 reform compensate for price reductions, the amounts could be seen as income support. Income levels vary between farmers and regions. The focus on preservation of the landscape and the environment as the main justification for support will reinforce the trend towards differentiation among
regions, which is already present in the application of the programme to promote agricultural activity protecting the environment. The 1988 CAP reform included an income aid scheme, which was optional for member states. But member states were reluctant to use the programme because it was complicated and blurred the line between agricultural support and welfare. Therefore, differentiation which is likely to increase, will avoid the appearance of welfare payments. An indirect way to deal with differences in income would be to use criteria related to the size of the exploitation. Such an approach may alleviate but will not solve the problem of what to pay to the farmers of future member states. Differentiation based on income levels may have to be accepted eventually.
The role of agriculture in the economy and society: Group discussion and a commentary
by Jerzy Wilkin
Agriculture is that kind of activity which joins labour, land or soil, live animals, plants, solar energy and so on; and the Minister of Agriculture is the Minister of the Beginning of Life. So people who are involved with that kind of activity are involved in something special.
Attitudes towards agriculture change in relation to the level of development. In less developed countries there is a tendency to treat agriculture as normal life, as a regular or common type of activity. In highly developed countries, where only a small fraction of the people are employed in agriculture, there is a tendency to treat agriculture in a special way. Poland is between these two extremes so there is not the tendency to treat farmers as people chosen by God. This attitude is changing toward that held in Western Europe.
Assessing the role of agriculture
It is interesting that the importance of agriculture in the economy in the six original member states in the late 1950s appears statistically very similar to Poland today in terms of agricultural employment as a share of total employment and the contribution of agriculture as a share of the total economy. That would mean that we are about 40 years back in development. I do not think so. It is a special situation, but times are different now from what they were in 1958, or slightly later, and changes are coming much more quickly. I think that closing the gap will take less time than it would have 40 years ago. But still it will take a lot. We observe in my country a kind of acceleration of development. It goes beyond my expectations. It is much faster than I expected five or six years ago, including in agriculture. Changes in the structure, area, size of the holdings, and so on, are occurring much faster than any predictions. So I hope it will not take 40 years to catch the
train, but less.
I remember the first statements of the Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, who was also the main author of economic reforms in Poland. It was at the start of his term at the end of 1989. He was asked by somebody about agriculture.
If somebody would come to me and ask for special preferential credits for agriculture, or for any special treatment of agriculture, I would resign immediately. There is no reason to treat agriculture as a special part of the economy. Mining and ore extracting industries are in a terrible situation, construction industries, also. Why not treat construction industries or extracting industries in the same way, as a special case also?
His statements are those of a free market economist. He believes each sector of the economy should be treated the same, no preferences. Market forces should determine the situation of each sector. In the beginning, it was a widely-announced and popular policy. During the first one and one-half years it was in force, from 1990 to the middle of 1991, we did not have an agricultural policy. For one and one-half years there was no agricultural policy because there were only macro-economic policies. People like Mr. Leszek Balcerowicz accept some forms of macro-economic policy, but not sectoral policies. They simply hate those kinds of policies. The preference for macroeconomic policy - or free market policy - reflects the belief that a free market has advantages over a more controlled approach to managing the economy.
Specificity is the starting point for extra treatment of agriculture. If you believe agriculture is a special part of the economy that deserves special treatment, many believe you can start resolving Poland's problems. If this is true, others argue, this special treatment for agriculture may not be available for other parts of the economy. The problem of Specificity of agriculture or any one sector becomes a problem of political/economic resolution. If you say that there is Specificity in agriculture, it means that there are some values that are not attributed to other sectors, and you have to define those values.
Beliefs and values: the role of agriculture in society
The Specificity of agriculture absorbs the attention of many people in Poland. Why is it important? The reasons or beliefs attached to its importance vary.
In Western Europe there is a focus on rural life and its symbolic values for all who felt uncomfortable with the hostile modernisation of society triggered by industrialisation and urbanisation. I think that rural life is becoming attractive for highly developed countries.
In countries less developed, rural life means backwardness. It is something to be ashamed of. For example, Marx was very hostile in his attitude towards peasants. You may remember that he wrote about peasants or the rural life "as stupidity which should be absolutely destroyed. It should be transformed into industrial or socialist type production. The peasant economy and rural life are full of backwardness, stupidity" and so on. Since Marx was very popular in socialist countries for political reasons, rural life, traditional family values, individual holdings and all these things were viewed by Marxists as something old fashioned that should be modernised. So there is a legacy of the communist ideology - at least in the minds of people. It is quite idiotic.
Beliefs justifying a special role for agriculture
In the European Community several reasons are given to justify specific appreciation of agricultural activity:
∑ The farmer is producing the most basic goods for human livelihood.
∑ The farmer is providing social stability through his hard work and the particular structure of the rural society.
∑ The farmer's livelihood is subject to the volatility of weather conditions.
In general, I agree with them and they are very common in the countries of Central Europe. In Poland there is the tendency to add elements that stem from our history and past experiences. For example, our peasants are proud that they produce not only basic products, necessary for life, but also, that they have played a special role in fighting for freedom. There is a saying on all the flags and banners of the Peasant Party: 'Feed and protect.'
Also, the Catholic church is deeply rooted in the rural areas. Our peasants are 99 percent Catholic. One of the famous figures in the history of the Polish church. Cardinal S. Wyszynski wrote several papers about the role of peasants strengthening Poland. In one of several papers about the roles of peasants stressing that the territory of Poland shifted several times, he wrote that where peasants speak Polish the nation is rooted in the soil. The nation is where the peasant is on the soil. This is often presented as a special value of farming and peasants.
A fourth reason used to justify the special treatment of agriculture is regional disparities. Regional disparities link with something that is called social justice. Income differences and also differences in the level of infrastructure development mean that the people do not have the same access to the basic services, to the basic achievements of the civilisation. It is unjust. To change this disparity means to bring social justice to life. So it is important and worth stressing that rural policy and agricultural policy may add a special factor to the idea of social justice. It is becoming important in constructing rural policy in Poland and in other post-communist countries because during the last six years this disparity is growing very, very quickly. Looking at the differences in local income in gminas (gmina - the smallest administrative area or unit -similar to a county in the US), according to the latest surveys, the 10 percent (or 295) gminas having the highest
incomes compared with the 10 percent (or 295) with the lowest, have per capita income ten times as high. This is a problem. Regional disparities do not exist only in the European Community, they have become a problem in Central Europe too.
The role of economic efficiency - then and now
Interestingly, the values that are basic values for Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the European Community, a common market, financial solidarity and community preference, are the same values used to justify socialist integration like the COMECON (Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). But in socialist countries it was not implemented, as we know. In the case of the European Community, the progress is quite good, but the goals not fully achieved.
The idea of raising farmers' incomes is a very important part of the CAP and the general agricultural policy in the community. There is a statement in Moehler's paper that in the fast years of European Community (EC) existence, "policy was aimed at increasing the incomes of farmers that did not flow exclusively from the increase of productivity."
As we know, the productivity has grown faster than the incomes of farmers in the Community during the last 25 years. Of course, there was income support in the community, but the money that was pumped into agriculture helped farmers to increase productivity tremendously. European agriculture is a great success in terms of productivity. This is an important issue in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and so on, and will be for the next few years because they cannot pump money into agriculture to increase productivity. They start from a very low point in productivity. The difference between the productivity of Western European agriculture and Central and Eastern European agriculture will be there for many years. Addressing the productivity problem is becoming a number one goal for agricultural policy in Poland and in other countries. To increase productivity in agriculture is combined usually with competitiveness in agriculture. So the emphasis is on productivity plus
competitiveness.
The relationship between the farmer and society
The role of prices of food-stuffs in agricultural products becomes less relevant when the general income level increases and the share of food in household expenditures decreases. It is only at 15 percent of household spending in Western Europe, but in practice in Central Europe it is closer to 40 percent. So it is still a very sensitive element. The price of food is politically and economically a very important and very sensitive issue. The mass media is criticising the behaviour and demands of farmers' organizations by pointing out that agriculture and food products constitute about 40 percent of total spending in Polish households. When you increase prices, there will be inflation - a problem for so many families. There is a different perspective on this issue among farmers and consumers.
The family farm
The Role of Agriculture in the Economy and Society makes the point that despite all the development in Western European agriculture, it has not affected the essence of the traditional family farm. The family farms have changed a lot, but still there are mostly family farms, and there is something stable in the farms. This is confirmed by the experience of the post-communist countries. Even during the communist period, that the essence of the farm survived even in some countries where collectivisation was predominant. There were small household plots that represented the essence of the farm. This is difficult for general historians, economists or rural sociologists to understand.
In market economies added value is so important because added value is the measure of productivity. In the family farms added value is an attachment to the traditional values. It is true for peasant farms, of course, Russian economist A.V. Chayanov presented one of the best analyses of the peasant economy in literature, when he stressed the point that in the peasant farm you cannot create activity as a business firm creates routine activity. Profit is not the main goal; there is no maximisation of profit. There are some other very important goals from day to day. I think that added value is something additional to traditional values in family farms, especially peasant farms. It is not the same in commercial farms, especially those with hired labour.
Poland, it must be recognised, during the socialist period, was an exception, in the sense that they kept a significant peasant agriculture. Poland with its agriculture structure, was really unique in the centre of the east European environment. The development in all other places was quite different. In Bulgaria it was extreme. While it was not so extreme in Hungary where the private agriculture survived in the form of household plots. But the tradition of family farming was virtually destroyed everywhere, except Poland. It is a question whether it is possible to have a revival of these family farms or not. That is one of the crucial issues, what is happening with the farming structure, apart from Poland. Some contend Poland was a very interesting case because Poland kept the fragmented family farm, and did not let this agriculture develop.
Hungarian agriculture, for example, became much more efficient with the large-scale cooperative structure than the Polish one because, at least in the Hungarian structure, there was a scope for managerial independence. There was a quasi-market working. They could invest. They were free. While in Poland that structure was frozen, more or less. That is why Poland inherited an undeveloped agricultural structure.^15
^15 This commentary about agriculture in other East European countries occurred during discussions at the Lake Balaton seminar in September 1996.
What is happening right now? Many experts believe family fanning in the Western European way, will be the major way of fanning in Central and Eastern Europe. The family farm is coming back in a few countries, surprisingly, in the Baltics, where there are few people and a lot of land. However, not in the Czech Republic, nor in Hungary, nor in Slovakia do you see the family farm. Albania is China. What happened in Albania is the Chinese way and cannot be compared with the rest. This is very important to Western Europe's underlying values.
The polarisation of agrarian structure
Since the fall of communism some big farms are emerging in East Germany, the former Democratic German Republic (DGR). There is also an area in Western Poland that was within German boundaries before the war. Now, after the collapse of state farms, there is a growing number of really big farms. I remember from the report of the agency responsible for state sector restructuring and transformation that during the first five years of its operation more than 3,000 farms have emerged with an average size of over 500 hectares. Some of them have 1,000 or 1,500 hectares. These are very big farms. Why is this important? Because it causes a change in the attitude of the people towards agriculture. They ask why should we support agriculture and agricultural producers, especially those who have 1,000 hectares and are becoming like owners of latifundia.^16 This is a contradiction of their concept of fanning as an area occupied by family farms, small and medium sized farms.
^16 A Spanish term describing a large agricultural estate.
The picture of agriculture is changing because of the emergence of such big farms. It causes political discussion even in parliamentary circles. It is a proposal, and I hope it will be overcome, to accept legal regulation about the upper size limits for the family farms. First, there is a need to define what a family farm is. How should government policy treat such farms? Should such farms have preferential treatment? Because the peasant party is a very strong party, the second largest in the parliament, and also the ruling party, together with the post-communist party, they can approve this proposal in the parliament. They have a majority, but there is some controversy within the party. For example, one of the leading figures in the peasant party, the Minister of Agriculture, is an owner of a very big, bigger than average, farm in Poland. His sons also have quite big farms. So there is a conflict of interests - also among the communists. There are some former directors of
the state farms who now operate private farms with 2,000 - 3,000 hectares.
They are very good managers and can operate such farms. From my point of view as a scholar, I can say that any form of codification or stating in a legal document that such and such entity is a real family farm - or is not a family farm - is conceptually very difficult. This is one result from the emergence of a new kind of farm in Central Europe, the same as those in East Germany. It is a part of the problem that is called polarisation of the agrarian structure. All countries in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced this polarisation. On one side we had a large number of small farms with two hectares, for example, and the number of the farms is relatively stable. We also have a growing number of very big farms. But the number of farms in between those with six, seven or eight hectares is declining. They are all small or big. I remember in one of the American publications the saying, "Get big, or get out." It was very popular. It is becoming the same in Poland. You
should get bigger, especially to face the competition in European agriculture. It contributes to the problem of social justice, social and economic policy, etc. Maybe we have the beginning of the strengthening of a bimodal agricultural system in Central Europe.
New concerns and shifting values
In the European Community the farming community has a hostile reaction to programmes that reduce arable areas. There is also a hostile reaction in Central Europe, but we have idle land, not because of government programmes, but because of the collapse of the state or co-operative farms.
It is a shame for the economic policy in Poland that 39 percent of the land that was in the state farms is not cultivated at the moment because of problems with land transfer. According to the last record that I read, there were 4.2 million hectares, or 20 percent of the total arable land, in state farms. One-third of those 4.2 million hectares, or nine percent of the total land, is still not cultivated because the state farms collapsed, and the new operators have not entered yet because of many problems, legal, financial and so on.
The next point in Moehler's paper deals with the new values for agricultural policies. Such values as food safety, quality of food and environment are well known. Some people add ethics to that - ethics associated with agricultural production.
During the VIII European Congress of Agricultural Economics in Edinburgh, L. Mahe presented an interesting paper^17 on the new protectionism driven by problems of ethics, environment and so on. New values are behind the agricultural, food and protectionism policies. Environment is becoming a very important aspect. There is progress in Central Europe in that one of the achievements of the last five or six years is the reduction in pollution. Sometime the reduction is 40 percent or 50 percent because of several reasons, but mostly because of the closing of the most polluting factories. Public awareness of the environmental problem is growing.
^17 Mahe, Louis, New protectionism in International Trade - A European Perspective and the Role of the CAP, Plenary Paper, VIII Congress of European Association of Agricultural Economists, Edinburgh, September 3-7, 1996.
Food safety and quality
The food safety is a new problem and it is becoming popularised. For example, some of our producers started to use food safety as an argument against the importation of goods. Farmers argue that imported goods have some chemical ingredients, and so on; therefore, "Buy Polish products - they are safer because they are produced in a more natural way."
Environment and productivity
When you compare the old major values and goals, for CAP and for programmes in Central Europe, I think that the list will be the same, but the emphasis will differ. In first place would be productivity and competitiveness. For example, food security is regarded as one of the important aspects, but because of the liberalisation of trade, it is not so important as it was some years ago. Preserving the natural landscape and environment is included, but is not considered as important as productivity. I think we have a unique chance to avoid some of the mistakes in development that were present in Western Europe and to combine productivity with preserving the landscape and the environment. It is one of the lessons we should learn from the Western countries.
Promoting rural development
There is a shift from agricultural policy to rural policy in my country. In 1994, some government documents were presented about rural policy and the need to shift from agricultural policy to rural policy. This shift may portend new functions for agriculture. Rural development policy is discussed as multi-functional in rural areas, but agriculture is also multi-functional - essentially it is combining the functions for rural areas and agriculture. In the document presented by the Council of Europe, called the European Charter for Rural Areas, significantly distressed rural areas will be treated in completely new ways. We should appreciate rural areas and present agriculture as not a producer of agricultural good, but as a source of multi-functional activity. It is changing both in Western Europe and in Central Europe.
Economic shock therapy for agriculture
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports increased support in terms of Producer Subsidy Equivalents (PSEs) in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. There is an important story about the PSEs. In the last three or four years it was presented in some reports that at the end of the socialist period (1988, for example), PSE in Poland was about 28 percent. It was lower than in the European Community, but it was high. In 1990 and 1991, it dramatically dropped to minus 18 percent. And in the next two years, increased to between 13 and 15 percent. Relatively speaking, it is not high. It is higher in Hungary and probably higher in the Czech Republic.
The issue is not how high PSE is; it is the sharp change from 28 to minus 18, which caused farmers to demand increased protection, to do something. It was a part of the shock therapy - and shock therapy is not a good therapy. It produced negative consequences because the attitude of farmers towards liberalisation, a market economy, had shifted during the first years from one position to its opposite.
At the end of the socialist period the peasants or the leaders of the peasants supported the idea of a market economy. They thought that they could survive and develop with the new market environment. For the peasant the difficulties of the first years were a shock for them - especially because of the shock therapy, shock liberalisation, including the opening of the borders for any kind of activity, almost no tariffs, no border protection and also no support from the government. Government support declined, in real terms, five times in two years. So that is the problem of the transitional economy.
What is the added value agriculture provides that justifies this special treatment? For me, the problem is how to measure that added value. It is so difficult to measure some reserves of the agricultural policy. There are some values agriculture provides - serving as a shock absorber. It plays such a role in my country. There were several cases in which agriculture played such a stabilising role, as well as the role of shock absorber. The role of agriculture is probably less important for highly developed countries, but for countries where 20 to 25 percent of the people live from agriculture, it could serve as a shock absorber.
It is difficult to measure other aspects of the added value regarding the protection of landscape or environment. In Edinburgh a paper was presented on how to arrange contracts with farmers. When you have contracts, you must monitor the contracts. What is the contract? The farmer will protect the natural landscape, and we will pay him some money. Agricultural policy is becoming more complicated, in my opinion, because of the new values and new goals for agricultural policy.

Agriculture in the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries is undergoing a fundamental transformation. The far reaching changes surpassing the reforms of earlier years characterise the agricultural economies of Central and Eastern Europe. Under present economic and political conditions the CEE countries have no alternative to the establishment of market-driven agricultural sectors based on private ownership. The process of reform has yet to be completed in any of the countries concerned, and it is now clear that the transformation is essentially more complicated and complex process than predicted by domestic and foreign experts and politicians. This paper intends to cover the process of change regarding the overall economic structure of agriculture and the change in underlying values and beliefs in order to get a better understanding of current developments as well as the forecasted course of developments in agricultural policies.
The heritage of the centrally planned system
In the 1950s and 1960s, in all CEE countries, the so-called socialist reorganization of agriculture was carried out. In practical terms this meant a collectivisation of the predominant small-holders agricultural system according to Soviet models. By the middle of the 1960s, the state farms and agricultural cooperatives became predominant in all the countries, except Poland. The organization of the socialist 'large-scale farms,' as they were called, was accompanied by the introduction of central planning, and by the establishment of the agricultural production system directed according to centrally determined and planned figures.
The agricultural policies in this period in the respective countries were based on the premise that agriculture forms an integral part of the centrally planned national economy. The basic targets for agriculture were formulated in the national economic plans. The most important objective of agricultural policy was to produce the quantity of food needed for the planned level of personal consumption and to satisfy the industrial demand for agriculture products. These general targets of course depended on the specific conditions and on the actual economic situation in each country. In spite of the similarities in the basic structure of the agricultural sector, no uniform agricultural policy spread throughout the countries regarding the implementation of the overall planned targets. In the classic system of centrally planned agriculture the overall national targets for agriculture were implemented by the integrated system of smaller-scale plans designed for specific sub-sectors
of agriculture, for regions, and for individual farms. Obviously, in this system the freedom of decision making at the lower levels was rather limited. In some countries, for certain periods, even the production technology was assigned for individual farms. During the more recent years, in some countries, the goals of the overall targets were implemented by using indirect methods, and various instruments of market economy such as prices, profit motivation, etc. It has to be underlined that even in these cases (e.g., Hungary and Poland in the late 1970s and 1980s) the plan always had a priority over the market, and the market instruments were used to implement the planned targets rather than as major instruments of controlling the agriculture.
The agricultural investment policy was also developed according to central plans and was determined by central planners. The scale of investment in agriculture or its share of the total at any time reflected the overall strategy of planners. In general, the development of industry was central to the economic policy, and part of the income generated by agriculture was often redistributed for the development of industry. Sometimes, however, when the planning authorities gave priority to the increase in personal food consumption, the agricultural sector would receive considerable investment resources, often much higher than its eventual contribution to the national income.
An important universal general characteristic of the agricultural policy was the vigorous effort for self-sufficiency. In each country, planners put an emphasis on meeting domestic demands for all commodities that could be produced in the given country as far as possible from domestic production. In those countries where natural conditions are favourable to agriculture, the maximisation of foreign currency receipts from agricultural foreign trade was also a rather important target for planners. Under this philosophy, quantity had a priority over quality, producing more was the crucial objective put before efficiency and competitiveness.
As a result of the priorities in plans, the domestic prices, and the income situation did not reflect actual economic performance. Domestic prices were mainly tools to aggregate various types of products rather than to reflect values and actual supply-demand relations. The whole system was based upon the philosophy of low food price and low wages. Food prices were kept artificially low and unchanged in order to be able to keep wages low and unchanged. As a result, the financial performance of a single farm had no real relation to the efficiency of production at that given unit. Production expenses were often higher than the procurement prices imposed by the state distribution system. Deficits or losses were always covered and farms were never liquidated.
The real markets for agricultural products and inputs did not exist, the only exception were the products of the household farms and those of small gardens. Both agricultural outputs and inputs were distributed rather than marketed. The domestic prices, therefore, had no market clearing role and had no direct relationship to the border price of the products. Foreign trade obviously was also part of the central planning system with the state foreign trade agencies holding a full monopoly. This system was in reality equivalent to a high level of protectionism, although this was implemented by the planners' decisions and not by the market economies' methods. Foreign trade decisions reflected planned targets and not domestic market situations.
The agricultural policy considered the so-called socialist large-scale enterprises, cooperative and state farms, to be the fundamental pillars of agriculture. With the exception of Poland, these farms were dominant in both land use and output (Table 1). Private production was considered to be a temporary phenomenon which was allowed but not supported. Only the household plots belonging to the co-operative farm members were regarded as an integral part of the large-scale farming system. In spite of this hostile environment, private agriculture provided a significant portion of agricultural output due to the better utilisation of resources and benefits gained informally through their links with the large-scale farms.
After a relatively short time it became evident that the administrative central direction regulating the agricultural production limited the growth of the sector and the signs of the unsatisfactory performance of the system appeared relatively early in the 1960s. The first reform attempts date to this period. The history of socialist agriculture is a history of reforms that proved to be unsuccessful or produced only partial results. In the first phase of the reform, in the 1960s, attempts were made to improve the planning methods and to develop the means to implement the planned targets. In the successive reforms, the decentralisation, the increase in farm independence, the need for the application of economic incentives became central. All of these reforms, however, could not step beyond the limits of the socialist economy as a whole, therefore they did not result in a visible improvement in agricultural performance. Even Hungarian agriculture, which was the most successful
among all the centrally planned economies due to early implementation of indirect and market type control methods, showed signs of serious efficiency problems by the mid 1980s.

The aftermath of decades of socialism is largely similar throughout the region. The food and agriculture of CEE countries on the eve of the transition was characterised by:
∑ Large inefficient farms and food processing enterprises with excessive scale of production and eroded incentives for efficient and profitable production.
∑ High levels of food consumption relative to market economies of comparable prosperity.
∑ Subsidised food prices and excess demand for food and subsidised prices.
∑ Artificially controlled trade and pricing policy which distorted the sector priorities and incentives.
∑ Excessive transfer of financial resources which neither addressed the underlying structural problems nor resolved efficiency issues.
∑ A widespread monopoly in food processing and distribution.
∑ The absence of institutions required by private, market-based agriculture.
The decades of planned economy obviously had an impact on values and beliefs related to agricultural policy and to agriculture in general. While the almost half century of centrally planned agriculture was not long enough for a fundamental change in attitudes and aspirations, it was long enough to result in changes which need to be taken into account when the current development and future perspective in agriculture policies are being assessed. The major impacts are:
∑ Quality lost importance to quantity as a measure of success.
∑ Performance was given a new interpretation: subjective evaluation of planners became dominant.
∑ Limited understanding of market functioning.
∑ Declined entrepreneurship.
∑ Decreased confidence in Government and institutions, including the legal frame-work in general.
∑ Bias against private business and foreign ownership.
∑ Risk avoidance and a high degree of suspicion in both political and economic environments.
∑ Lack of trust in collective efforts and search for individual survival techniques.
Progress in creating a new economic structure in agriculture
The political changes that affected the entire region in the late 1980s and early 1990s created new conditions for reforms in agriculture. The former goal of reforming the socialist agriculture system was replaced throughout the region by the new goal of changing the regime and creating a market type agrarian economy based on private ownership. The current ongoing agrarian reforms in CEE countries are aimed at realising the latter objective. The creation of a market economy and privatisation in agriculture involves the following actions:
∑ The creation of a new macro-economic framework for agriculture: price and market liberalisation.
∑ Land reform and creation of a new farming structure based on private ownership of land and productive assets.
∑ The creation of a competitive environment for agriculture: privatisation in agro-processing, input supply, services, and trade.
∑ The creation of a rural financial system, serving the needs of privatised agriculture and agricultural services.
∑ Institutional reform creating institutions and public services required by a market economy.
In theory, Central and Eastern Europe has the possibility of shaping a legislative and regulatory system which, combined with adequate capital input, can bring about the creation of the farming structure most suitable for the market circumstances. At present, the region has only partly taken advantage of this possibility. What is the reason for this? One of the most important features of the past few years has been the predominance of politics over economic rationality. In all the CEE countries, agricultural transformation is taking place fundamentally as a process guided by political, often short-term, motivations in which the economic considerations and the effort to create an efficient new structure, as rapidly as possible, play a secondary role. The beliefs inherited from the communist period, distorted and often illogical views of the market economy have played a significant role in Central and Eastern Europe. As a result of the ideologically-charged prejudices against
the inherited structure and the overemphasis on seeking justice and reprivatisation, the output has fallen by a greater extent than necessary, the loss of fixed assets has been greater than justifiable, land ownership has become fragmented, and people not engaged in fanning have acquired a substantial share of land ownership. On the other hand, the political conservatism and the mistrust of private production and market relations often demand the continuation of subsidies in general and the preservation of the remaining larger-scale farms.
Beyond the common overall objectives the picture is far from being uniform in the region when it comes to the concrete forms and the implementation of the various tasks of transition (Table 2). There are substantial differences among countries in practically all the areas of reforms listed in the previous paragraph. However after five years of transition, it can be stated that the CEE countries have made significant progress in transforming their food and agricultural sector. It should be noted, however, that some countries, in particular the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, have made faster progress in their global transition, than in their agricultural sector reforms.

Looking at the analysis presented in Table 2, we can conclude that:
∑ the reform process in agriculture is more difficult than projected;
∑ the results do not exactly meet original expectations;
∑ the Central European countries, namely Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary, have made the most significant progress, while the transitions in Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania are still far from completion;
∑ the most significant progress can be seen in price and market liberalisation while rural financing, institutional reform, and privatisation of agro-processing seem to be lagging behind in the process.
It seems that the most critical issues which will determine the further progress in agricultural reforms are: a) the success in restructuring the agro-processing industries and trade; b) the speed in establishing an efficient support service environment, particularly a well functioning rural financial system to support privatised agriculture, farmers and processors; and c) the progress in creating public institutions consistent with the market economy, and particularly with EU standards. Efforts to strengthen liberal trade and market policies, and to consolidate private agriculture, need to be continued.
A competitive and efficient agriculture cannot be developed in CEE countries without recovery of the global rural economy. The productivity increase in agriculture requires a massive reduction in the agricultural labour force. The experience of the Czech Republic and Hungary indicates that this can be achieved only if the non-farm employment opportunities are in place, and if the rural services are improved significantly. Unfortunately, in most countries, the non-agricultural rural business activities are developing slowly, making the agricultural transition process more difficult. More attention, therefore, needs to be given to complex rural development, including the improvement of rural infrastructure.
The transformation of agriculture in Central and Eastern Europe is still far from being finished. The overview presented in Table 2 summarises not only the results achieved, but also the difficulty of transition. The transformation was further hampered by the decline in output (Table 3) which accompanied the first phase of the transition process and can be attributed only partly to the economic crisis and decline in demand. The rebound effect of the transformation is also considerable. The shift from large-scale farming to privatisation is generally a process of dismantling, and not a process of constructing. This is especially true for the first stage of the process. The loss of a part of the stock of fixed assets and other disorders are an unavoidable side effect of such a process. Unfortunately, the behaviour of the governments concerned has tended to strengthen rather than counterbalance these unavoidable negative effects.
There is a lack of general management of the transformation and a lack of comprehensive, consistent and carefully contemplated agrarian strategy. Instead, the process of transformation is being handled in an ad hoc manner with frequent changes and amendments, some having retroactive effects and some made during the process of its implementation. The legislation that underlies the agrarian transformation is not based on a clearly pondered and formulated programme, realised through a broad social consensus. The implementation of some of the new laws is beyond the administrative capacity of a country's state administration.
A further serious problem affecting the transformation is the shortage of capital and the conditions of the immediate economic environment surrounding agricultural production. One of the most restrictive factors for restructuring agriculture is the insufficiently developed and the centralised and monopolistic nature of the trade and processing structures, accompanied by the primitive financial system. It would appear that the debate concerning land ownership and the transformation of large-scale farms has obscured the recognition of the real impact of transformation in these fields. In the absence of a functioning market, private agriculture is defenceless. But without a stimulating macroeconomic environment and availability of investment sources, the development of agriculture is inconceivable. For this reason, the strengthening of the market framework with the creation of fair market competition, a functioning rural banking system, an active land market, and competitive
trade and processing industry are the conditions of vital importance for further advancement in the agricultural sector.

Impact of the transition upon individual components of economic structure in agriculture
Role of government
The transition to a market agriculture based on private ownership requires a fundamental change in the role of government in the agricultural sector and in the economy as a whole. Direct government intervention in agriculture, such as establishing mandatory targets for production and/or delivery of goods and central allocation of investments and inputs, must cease. The government's role should extend beyond the management of the difficult transition process: the government should establish general rules and facilitate the conditions for smooth operation of markets and independent business entities. This role is no less important than the previous one; however, it requires a different philosophy, as well as different means and institutions.
Agriculture in the Central East European countries has made the first fundamental steps toward a market driven system based on private ownership. Under these circumstances, the most important task for the governments and for the agriculture policy specifically, is to liquidate the obstacles preventing the emergence of a more competitive and efficient production system. The governments need to create the enabling environment for private sector growth, rather than remain directly involved in production management, according to the practice of the former regime. Unfortunately, for most of the governments, the transition to this new role is not a smooth and continuous process. The emergence of the new role of the government is constrained by the inherited beliefs that the government should take care of everything. The mix of social and agricultural policies is an additional typical problem. The governments try to resolve transition related social problems in rural areas by
agricultural policies, rather than by appropriate social measures. The influence of various interest groups, such as farm managers, newly-emerged private salesmen, and trade unions also slows down the emergence of the new role for the government.
As the consequence of the above-mentioned problems, during recent years, the agrarian sector in the region has been controlled by rules and regulations which are loosely connected and sometimes inconsistent. There are a great number of uncertainties affecting the farms: significant measures are often adopted with delay, and important agricultural policies are the outcome of bargaining over concrete individual situations. There is a need for a clear agricultural policy framework, for a comprehensive set of agricultural policy decisions oriented, not only towards managing the transition, but which will also create the foreseeable and reliable long-term conditions for the restructured and privatised agricultural sector. The major goals of the agricultural policy and the related system of instruments, with special reference to the budgetary consequences, have to be formulated for at least three to five years, similar to the practice of developed market economies, e.g., the US
Farm Bill.
In most countries the agricultural policy is obviously closely connected to the aspirations of various political and interest groups. Presently, the interests of producers and the trading sector are very clearly expressed. In most countries, however, representation of the consumers' interests is still very weak. The budgetary implications of agricultural policies are not well known. There is a strong need for a clear, transparent agrarian budget, which clearly illustrates the costs of various policy measures and shows who pays the bills. Subsidies are probably the most debated elements of the agricultural policies in the region. The general belief is that agriculture cannot function without subsidies and that the transition and the forthcoming EU accession, make the subsidisation of agriculture indispensable. There is less than a full understanding of benefits and shortcomings of the protective policies.
The dismantling of the bureaucratic structure inherited from the period of central planning is a very important task. Various ministries should not merely change their names, but need to undergo radical modification and/or merger. Units related to central command and direct intervention should be eliminated, while those remaining should be organised and managed to meet the needs of a free market system. As the transition proceeds, the whole structure can be simplified further, with fewer institutional units and fewer employees. Structural changes are needed in the regional units. In many countries, the large regional bureaucracies implementing central control, are still very strong. There is no need for then-existence in their present forms. A relatively small local administration would be adequate to enforce agricultural regulations, promote development, and provide extension and market information services.
Given the uniqueness of the region, its history and politics, it is not possible to define an exact structure of a modernised government administration of food and agriculture for the countries concerned. However, within a market-driven economic system the government should continue to play three roles: regulation, provision of public goods and support services, and information and analysis. Regulation should include food inspection, seed inspection, establishment and enforcement of grades and standards, establishment and control of phytosanitary standards, epidemiology and livestock disease control. The essential public services to be provided by the government should include domestic and foreign market information, agricultural research, farm advisory services, and higher education in agriculture. Finally, the government should monitor, review, and diagnose the implication of changing circumstances and develop options for public policy.
Land reform and farm restructuring
Inherited beliefs and values probably have been playing a more significant role in the course of changing the land ownership and the farm restructuring than in any other area of transition. On the one hand, among many people there is a deeply rooted belief in the superiority of private ownership and family farming over state and collective structures. While, on the other hand, the socially positive experience of collective fanning had an impact on the view of many other people. As a result, the land reform as it has been carried out in the region, reflects these conflicting views and beliefs.
Creating private land ownership
The creation of private land ownership is the starting point for land reform. It is around this issue that an intense political debate is raging in virtually all the countries in the region. Two closely linked tasks are involved here. One is the creation of a legal framework for private possession of land, and the other is me transfer of land into private ownership, the actual privatisation of land. In other words, it had to be decided who would receive land, by what procedures, and on the basis of what criteria. In Central East Europe, the legal recognition of private land ownership did not meet with strong opposition. Land in these countries has never been fully nationalised, and a tradition of private land ownership continued after World War II. The return to traditional values enjoys the full support of public opinion.
Eligibility, meaning the determination of who is entitled to receive land, is one of the major issues related to land ownership: one approach is to return land to the former owners (so-called restitution or reprivatisation of land), and the other is to distribute land to new beneficiaries regardless of the former ownership rights. The two approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive: land remaining after the claims of the former owners have been satisfied can be distributed to other beneficiaries. Moreover, restitution is not always implemented by actually returning the original plot of land to the former owner: due to technical considerations a substitute plot may be allocated or, instead of land, money compensation may be offered.
When the policy of land distribution, regardless of the former ownership rights, or the distribution of unclaimed land, is adopted, the legislators must decide the exact configuration of the beneficiaries. A number of different definitions of beneficiary groups have been considered in the CEE countries. The possible combinations of beneficiaries are listed below in the order of progressively more encompassing eligibility for land and non-land assets:
∑ only those who work the land ("land to the tiller"), usually including tiller-pensioners;
∑ all members of collective farms, including those not engaged in farming;
∑ all members and hired workers of collectives;
∑ all members and hired workers of the collective, as well as people employed in rural agricultural service enterprises and social services;
∑ the whole rural population;
∑ the whole rural population, as well as former rural residents satisfying certain criteria;
∑ sell the land on an open market.
In Central and Eastern Europe, reprivatisation or restitution dominates, supplemented by various schemes designed to provide land to agricultural producers who were not former owners. The Central and Eastern European countries in general recognised the rights of the former land owners. Compensation was provided in various concrete forms, varying from actual land restitution to financial compensation to allowing purchase of alternative land if desired. Albania is an example of full and rapid privatisation of the land. There, the vast majority of land previously part of the co-operatives and state farms was divided among the rural population, according to the size of the family, regardless of the former ownership. In Romania, the land of the co-operatives was transferred to former owners and co-operative members relatively quickly, in the space of approximately six months. The process is advancing more slowly in Bulgaria and the declared goals, which include the creation of
private farms of a rational size, understandably complicate the process. In both, the Czech and the Slovak Republics, the former owners can recover their land if they decide to cultivate it. In Hungary, the compensation of former owners has been based on a voucher system. As a result of this process, the great majority of agricultural land in Central and Eastern Europe will be privately owned in the near future, although the legal settlement of ownership rights will still take some time. The Baltic states, like the CEE countries, adopted a strategy of restitution to the former owners. Individual land users who are not former owners have to purchase land from the state reserve or from the new owners who do not wish to farm. Otherwise, they keep their rights to use the land, but they do not obtain the ownership rights.
Farm restructuring
In the process of developing private ownership and property markets in the former socialist agricultures, it is strategically important to separate the privatisation of land and assets from the restructuring of agricultural production. Though the possibility exists for a fast and simultaneous privatisation of both, land and non-land assets (as the dismantling of the large-scale farms in Albania demonstrates), this method would be acceptable only under very specific political and economic circumstances. Under the typical circumstances, land and non-land assets are allocated to private owners without a complete fragmentation or dismantling of the existing farm structure. With land and assets transferred to individual ownership, the process of restructuring agricultural production is guided by the free will of the individual owners, who choose to assign their land and assets to the organizational form which best satisfies their needs and preferences. This has to be an
open-ended dynamic process in which the new owners learn through the choices made regarding the management of their land, and adjust these choices over time in response to the experience gained.
The role of the government is to provide the framework for a smooth and flexible restructuring process. This process should be based on the individual decisions of the beneficiaries, who select freely among the various forms of farm management and land use. The government should, therefore, provide a legislative and policy framework which clearly recognises these various options and the freedom of choice of the beneficiaries, and reinforce it with an appropriate public information system.
Expeditious implementation of transfer and registration of land ownership depends entirely on allocation of sufficient resources for the registration and demarcation system. The physical registration process is hindered by the lack of suitable modem equipment and qualified personnel, but both, the equipment and training are a function of money and expertise, which can be provided by international donors. However, the frequent political opposition of special interest groups, that object to both private ownership of land and to the allocation process, represent a serious obstacle. The political opposition can be overcome only by educating the public as to their rights, options, and the exact nature of the process related to the change in the land ownership. This is a long-term process that requires political willingness and resolution to challenge the special interest groups.
Farm restructuring involves the creation of a market-oriented, profit-motivated farming structure, based on clear individual ownership of land and assets, and an incentive system encouraging individual responsibility and rewarding individual effort. The new farm structures may take a variety of forms. Some people will keep their land and shares of other assets and establish private (family) farms. Others will pool their land and assets and create small partnerships or farming cooperatives. Yet others may choose to lease their land to active agricultural producers and assume the role of 'inactive investors,' or, alternatively, focus on development of private farm support services. The former collectives will, thus, gradually break up into individual or smaller private farms or other fanning organizations in which the production will be based on privately owned land and assets. These new producers need to be supported by market services, some of which are provided by new
private entrepreneurs (individually or in groups) while others may be based on former collective management structures that will redefine their role and become service firms or co-operatives.
The results of restructuring in the CEE countries indicate that large-scale farming still plays an important role at this stage of the reform (Table 4). Yet the restructuring goes far beyond a mere 'changing of the sign on the door.' Most large-scale farms actually reorganised into several smaller functionally specialised units, built around the land and asset shares of their member-owners. The shareholders underwent fairly radical voluntary regrouping in the process of downsizing of the original farms. A significant degree of separation between ownership and management has been achieved in these new structures, which no longer guarantee employment to their shareholders. The new large farms in the CEE countries are thus definitely moving away from the traditional syndrome of the 'labour-managed firm' that in the past plagued the socialist economies.
The current features of the economic environment in most countries regarding restructuring are transitory. As the economic environment supportive of private activity outside the traditional farms improves, more holders of the land and asset shares will seek to withdraw shares and form new ventures, either individually or in combination with other shareholders. In view of the fact that the economic environment is still changing, and it is still severely behind in the development of market infrastructure in most of the Central and Eastern European countries, it is desirable that the options for restructuring remain open. Thus the recipients of the land rights who choose to remain in the collective-type enterprises should retain the right to exit with their land and assets at any point in the future. Whether the exit rights are protected, or property rights devolve to the enterprise when a shareholding company is formed, the withdrawal issues depend on the existing relevant
laws, and on the enterprises' by-laws' treatment of such issues.

The rate of the increase in the number of individual private farms across the region is far behind the original expectations (both local and international) and behind the possibilities provided by the legal framework. Different explanations, based on theoretical considerations and speculations, are given by the politicians and experts. The World Bank surveys conducted among the rural population indicate that the reluctance to becoming a private farmer is due to the lack of supportive conditions for private fanning. The cautious behaviour is thus an expression of the sober and realistic judgement of the situation of the peasantry. The present generation of CEE peasants has only limited or no skills necessary for successful private family farm management. However, in today's CEE, the most restrictive factor inhibiting the expansion of private farming remains the relatively modest income compared to the high risks involved. Progress down the path towards a market economy will
gradually establish the conditions that encourage further transformation of the fanning structure.
Land market
The allocation and distribution of land to individuals in the process of land reform is only the fast step toward the creation of a new and efficient farming structure. The system must facilitate the future exchange of land parcels between the individuals who wish to establish a farm of the size suitable for efficient farming, given the skills and resources in each particular case. The establishment of such farm sizes requires a functioning land market, where land parcels can be bought and sold, leased in and out, or exchanged. Without such markets, land will remain locked into an inherently inefficient distribution pattern despite private ownership. This was the case of Poland throughout the Communist period, where, in the absence of a land market, privately owned land could not be transferred to more efficient and more enterprising users. If the land markets are allowed to develop, land owners who are the least risk averse and most motivated to farm individually will be
able to increase their initial holding over time by renting or purchasing land from other, less active owners. Some beneficiaries may not want to farm individually at the first stage (or ever), and to avoid the underutilisation of valuable land resources, a legally clear process must be defined for inactive land owners to lease or sell land to those who want to farm. Procedures must also be developed to facilitate the consolidation of privately owned land into larger parcels as their new owners make the medium term decision about land utilisation. The development of a land market is still in the first stages, even in the most advanced CEE countries, which have already reached an advanced stage in the formulation and implementation of a legal framework for privatisation. However, the prevailing ideas about the rules that will govern land market functioning and private land ownership are extremely varied and not entirely reassuring. There are strong reservations about the
possibility of the emergence of large, privately owned farms. Many people fear the repetition of the old system of big estates and absentee owners, or at least rapid concentration of land ownership in a few hands. As a result, practically all countries impose various limitations to private land ownership.
Current and pending legislation in all countries of the region circumscribes owners' rights in the important areas of land transfer, land utilisation, and size of holdings. Typical restrictions on land transfer in various countries vary from an outright ban on buying and selling of land (indefinitely or during a long moratorium) to restrictive provisions which allow alienation only to residents in the same village, to local farm enterprise, or through intermediation of the state. Even the right to lease land to other farmers is still not universally accepted. Restrictions on land use typically include the obligation to farm the land, and to observe sound conservation practices. Failure to observe this rule can result in expropriation. Restrictions on size of holdings are universal. The maximum size of private farms is limited to 20-30 hectares in Bulgaria, 50 hectares in Latvia, and 100 hectares in Romania. Restrictions on the rights of owners are intended to prevent
absentee ownership and underutilisation of land resources. They are also intended to prevent new owners from becoming victims or beneficiaries of speculative land transactions. The restrictions on property rights reflect fundamental ambiguity regarding private land property, even where private ownership is legally recognised. The restrictions on land ownership rights are among the most contested issues of agricultural reform.
Various restrictions related to ownership rights, while often understandable in the historical and political context, are inconsistent with the principles of a market economy. These restrictions may become a serious obstacle to the shaping of an efficient economic structure based on private ownership and, in the final analysis, harm the competitiveness of agriculture in the region. Restrictions regarding land buying and selling and the size of holdings are not consistent with the need to stimulate the emergence of efficient farms. The requirement that land in agricultural use at the time of transfer of ownership remains indefinitely in agricultural use can inhibit much needed adjustments in land use patterns. Because of legal restrictions on transactions and because land rights, distribution has not been completed in a number of countries. Land markets are still not functioning and the correct market values of land are ignored. Valuation of land is often performed on the
basis of administratively decided formulas and models.
What are the prospects for the future?
It is now clear that, contrary to the original expectations, the transformation of large-scale agriculture will be a lengthy process. It is extremely difficult to foresee what type of units will emerge as dominant. The future agriculture in the region probably will be characterised by a variety of forms of farming operations. Private farms, restructured cooperatives, commercial farms of various sizes, and small part-time subsistence farms producing mainly for their own consumption will coexist side by side. Applying the major lessons of the first phase of the transition to assess the prospects for the future (without attempting to make more concrete predictions), the following issues deserve attention:
∑ The region's agriculture must adjust to the basically new internal and external circumstances. Rapid expansion of internal demand cannot be expected and capturing a permanent share of external markets requires a basic improvement in efficiency, quality, and competitiveness. In this situation, the level of output will remain for some time lower than that reached in previous years, which means that agricultural production cannot become the engine for general economic recovery. What is even more important, private production is emerging under conditions of strict efficiency requirements, hard budget constraints, and intense market competition, and this process will have losers as well as winners.
∑ A relatively large number of private farms may not be able to operate profitably, despite the initial support that many of them receive. It would be a serious mistake to keep these farms alive with further inflow of resources from the state budget. State support, if it is given at all, should serve to improve the general income conditions of agriculture and to enhance international competitiveness. A stratum of private farmers dependent on central government support could easily become an economic and political burden.
∑ The transition to a profitable and efficient agricultural structure should be completed as quickly as possible. The establishment of unequivocal and clear land-ownership relations is essential. In the future, the development of the farming structure should be shaped basically by the market relations and market tools, principally through an efficiently functioning land market. This means minimising the restrictions on land ownership and land use, as well as on ownership and lease rights. The transfer of ownership and lease rights should be simple and cheap. The greater the government intervention in the operation of the land market, the slower and more costly the shaping of the new farming structure will be. The leasing of land will have a very important role in shaping an efficient farming structure, and the conditions for leasing must be determined fundamentally by the supply and demand relation.
∑ It is unlikely that family fanning of the Western European type and scale will become the generally accepted model, not even over a longer period. The countries in the region cannot afford to provide state subsidies over a long period in order to keep alive farms that are not viable under free market conditions. For this reason, the desirable farm size and form of farming must be capable of generating self-sustainable profits without subsidies or with relatively small support. These farm sizes almost certainly will be many times larger than the average size of independent, family based private farms in CEE today (2-20 hectares), and possibly larger than farm sizes in some of the Western European countries.
∑ Given the traditional dual structure of former socialist agriculture and the emphasis on the household plots in the process of reform, it seems likely that the distinction between the subsistence fanning and the commercial farming will persist for some time in the future throughout the region. The success of the ongoing process of land reform and farm restructuring will be judged by the gradual increase in the number of commercially viable small and medium-size farms and continued downsizing of the traditional large-scale structures. Persistence of a dual structure of small subsistence plots and large subsidy-dependent capital-intensive farms will surely signal failure of the process.
∑ In international practice, agricultural production co-operatives have proven less efficient than individually owned farms, especially in environments with adequately functioning markets. The development of market forces will lead to further disintegration and transformation of many agricultural production co-operatives that still exist in these countries. Because of the social and political implications, the changes should be achieved not through administrative intervention but through the market and efficiency instruments, just as in the case of privately owned farms.
∑ The strengthening and the expansion of processing, marketing, purchasing, and other service co-operatives is expected to gain momentum in the future. These service cooperatives will provide a viable support framework for the growth of private farms which will be detached from the collective sector still undergoing the process of transition. The development of service cooperatives calls for government attention and support.
∑ Rural finance is one of the components of the farm support system which at present is still not developed in any of the CEE countries. The traditional financial system in the socialist countries is not oriented to meet the needs of the new private agriculture. Debt writing off and interest rate subsidies will be eliminated as agriculture moves toward the market. Both banks and borrowers will have to pay attention to the concept of creditworthiness and will have to take loan repayment seriously. A mortgage finance system will have to be developed as soon as private land ownership and land titles are instituted and the legal restrictions on the use of land as collateral are removed. Rapidly some new, creative financial solutions may emerge as alternatives to the scarcely developed banking system. This could include suppliers' and marketers' credits associated with farmers' product delivery. Development of village-level credit societies and mutual credit arrangements is
also a possibility for meeting the financial needs of a small private farmer.
∑ Finally, special attention should be paid to the social aspects of the transformation in agriculture. The decline in production and the change of ownership structure are obvious sources of social problems and tensions. Agriculture will be able to contribute to the solution of these problems only within the framework of efficient and profitable production. The fundamental objective of agrarian policy thus should be the achievement of an efficient and profitable farming structure based on private ownership. The governments should avoid the pitfalls of using agrarian policy to resolve social issues, and leave the solution of rural social problems to social policy instruments. Any deviation from this direction will have tangible negative economic consequences.
There are many problems to be solved, but the basic final message is not the one of despair. Most of the countries concerned are not poor and most of them can be self-sustaining, creditworthy and have access to markets. But we must recognise the complexity of the changes taking place; the social costs; the political strains; the investments needed in nation-building. It is necessary to face the reality, the future tasks and problems, and take into account the time required to solve them. In particular, the following points should be emphasised:
∑ Dedicated people are at work trying to change the system and make the new approaches work. But there is fear of the future.
∑ This is not a question merely of revealing a pool of latent entrepreneurial talents. Generations of experience have taught risk avoidance, suspicion, and survival techniques aimed at circumventing the system.
∑ The scale of the problem is unprecedented.
∑ All previous discussions about sequencing have become academic.
∑ Speed is essential but also difficult. Efforts need to be focused on:
* actions which will show results quickly (retail privatisation, SME development in opportunities);
* actions which will offer opportunity to more people and involve them in the process.
No one today is in a position to project where the agricultural sector of various Central and Eastern European countries will be at the end of the decade. We can only state with some certainty that:
∑ They will not all have evolved in the same way, nor at the same pace.
∑ Not all transformations which have been initiated will be fully completed.
∑ Progress will not be linear. There will be setbacks.
∑ Institutional weaknesses, social structures, attitudinal changes will slow down structural change and growth in agriculture.
To avoid disappointments, it is better to be realistic from the beginning. The early euphoria envisioned a quick transformation, followed by an equally quick supply response. But developments thus far, and the experience of both the Central and Eastern European countries and East Germany, suggest otherwise. Gradually, the perception is growing that the process will be slower than anticipated and that, consequently, the social and political strains on very fragile systems, greater. However, one also has to be convinced that the whole task is not impossible. The region has all natural, economic and human resources to become a fully integrated and prosperous part of the developed world and the European Union, specifically, in the foreseeable future.

Economic structure and performance in the food and agriculture sector of central and Eastern European Countries: A commentary
by Aart de Zeeuw
After the break down of the communist system in the CEE countries in 1989, the agricultural sector faced a very difficult position. After five years of democratic development the situation is much better, but not yet back to the level of the 1980s.
Most reports about future development show a more or less optimistic view, but all of them conclude that in these countries it is necessary to develop an agricultural policy, which is focused on shaping a solid legal basis, a better market and infrastructure, credit facilities, clear rules regarding health and quality of agricultural products and a better system of research, education and extension, as well as privatisation.
The position of the EU towards the CEE countries is ambiguous
Politically, the EU wants to give the CEE countries the possibility of becoming full members rather quickly. On the other hand, the EU realises that access in the short term is almost impossible because of the great differences between the EU countries and the CEE countries, economically, socially and legally.
Adaptation takes time!
Most of the EU countries also fear that a rapid accession would slow down the process of further unification within the EU; only the UK does not want a further unification of the EU on social, foreign and defence policy. In my view, the only way to solve this dilemma is through a process of formal access in the rather short term together with the introduction of a transition period in which certain border measures are implemented to prevent economic and social chaos.
The length of the transition period and the content of the border measures can vary from country to country, and will be the result of negotiations. From a legal point of view it is formally not possible to introduce a transition period, since the EU has accepted the 'Single Market,' which means that at the moment of formal accession the market becomes completely open. This procedure has occurred with the accession of Finland, Sweden and Austria. This was possible because the economic and social structure in these countries did not differ too much from the existing members of the EU.
The case of the accession of the CEE countries is different, which is why I think that if there is a political need to accept an early formal accession of these countries, the old procedure (followed in the accession of Spain, Portugal and Greece) with a rather long transition period will be necessary.
Another important argument for a rather long transition period is based on the probability of a change of the CAP in the EU toward replacing price support with direct income support and an integration of agricultural policies into rural development policies.
These changes also need time, in my view at least five to ten years. It is obvious that the development of agricultural and rural policies in the CEE countries need to fit in this probable development in the EU and that also takes time.
Are there differences in beliefs and values between the members of the EU? In my comments on the papers of Petit and Doucha I concluded that we need to emphasise the general and global belief that the agricultural community is one of the important pillars sustaining the development of rural areas. This is true for all member states in the EU as well as all countries in central and eastern Europe.
Differences between member states in the EU are the result of different views on how to support farmers and their families. The discussion focuses mainly on the alternative between price and income support. More market-oriented countries like UK, Denmark, Netherlands, parts of France (not the southern part) and Sweden more easily accept the change from price to income policy, than countries like Germany, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy.
In accordance with what has been said, the solution for the EU and also for countries who want to become members of the EU is:
∑ accepting a process of gradually lowering prices in the EU; with a view of an ongoing process of liberalisation of agricultural markets during the first decade of the next century;
∑ replacing price supports with direct income support, in particular, in regions where restructuring is necessary to become competitive with efficient fanning regions and in regions where direct income support is necessary to support farming for social and environmental reasons.
Agricultural policy needs to become more and more integrated into rural development policy.
My conclusion is, that in the EU the member states do not differ in their belief, that agriculture is of great value for the society, in particular, for the rural areas, but that they differ in the way agricultural and rural policies need to be implemented.
Group discussion on "Structure and performance in the food and agriculture sector"
The discussion of the situation in Central Europe focused on some of the differences in the individual countries and on some of the similarities. It was pointed out that in Poland there had been a land market, even during the communist period. That market was limited by numerous rules, but it was possible to buy and sell land. The land market in Poland is now functioning within limits, mostly created by restrictions against foreign ownership of farmland. However, most of the limitations on the functioning of the land market in Poland come from the economic position of farmers and not from legal restrictions placed by policies.
There was general agreement that none of the Central European countries have agricultural policies aimed at supporting or speeding the restructuring of their agricultural systems. The major criteria for policies seems to be that they not be heavy drains on national budgets. Moreover, the policies that are put in place focus more on rural development, rural infrastructure, and environment, than on improving the structure and efficiency of agriculture in the countries. In addition, there has been little or no attention to the restructuring of the upstream and down-stream parts of the food and agriculture sector. This further handicaps the farms in Central Europe in terms of competition with farms in Western Europe or elsewhere.
In the Czech Republic an organization called the Agrarian Chamber serves as an umbrella organization to reduce the conflicts between farmer-producers and monopolistic processors and input suppliers. When some producer groups tried to establish co-operatives to market products to processors, the Ministry of Competitiveness forced them to stop their independent action and become members of the Agrarian Chamber.
In Hungary there are non-governmental product councils of processors, traders, and raw material producers. These groups discuss the market situation, make proposals for government fixing of minimum prices, and agree on the minimum price the processors will pay for the product in that season. Sometimes these councils decide who is going to produce or export and operate to limit supply and raise prices. The privatisation of sugar processing has brought in some foreign processors which compete with those that are owned locally, but they all belong to the Hungarian Sugar Producers Association that is sort of a cartel. The input supply industry is fairly competitive because it is fairly easy to buy supplies in nearby countries if prices are too high in Hungary.
One of the major problems in Hungary is the lack of credit facilities for farmers. Land cannot be used as collateral and there are no government subsidies for credit. Therefore, much of the credit for production of products such as grain comes from elevators and traders who sign forward contracts for grain in exchange for credit advances to producers. This, of course, leaves the producers in a weakened position.
The discussion brought out that many countries in Western Europe have laws designed to prohibit the ownership of farms by foreigners, and to maintain family-sized farms. In France there is a Society for The Improvement of Land and Establishment of Rural Settlement. This organization is a private entity that receives public money and is very involved in the land market. When farms are sold, there are restrictions on who can bid for them and get the allocations. This institution was set up initially to encourage farm consolidation and modernisation, but it now may be inhibiting restructuring in the name of the family farm, while at the same time reducing the competitiveness of the agricultural sector.
In general the discussion indicated that there are continuing problems in the process of restructuring of agriculture in the former communist countries. Some of the problems are created by conflicting values about how the sector should be structured, who should own the resources in the sector, and what government policy toward the sector should be. However, on examination it turns out there are many of the same conflicting values on the same issues in Western Europe. In both Western and Central Europe there is widespread support for government intervention in the land market to affect who owns farms.

Group discussion on "Beliefs and values regarding government intervention in markets"
Western European beliefs and values regarding government intervention in agriculture and food prices1
by Michel Petit^2
^1Paper presented at the Seminar on Beliefs and Values Underlying Agricultural Policies, Lake Balaton, Hungary, September 18-24, 1996.
^2Michel Petit is Director of the Agricultural Research Group at the World Bank, Washington, D.C. The following paper does not necessarily represent the official policies of the World Bank.
The purpose of this paper, as indicated by its title, is to review the set of beliefs, attitudes and values which have affected Government price interventions for agriculture and food in Western Europe. Such interventions constitute a major component of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union since price and market interventions have indeed led to the largest budget expenditures and they have caused the greatest friction with outsiders as these issues figured prominently in the recent Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations. These interventions also will probably constitute the major obstacle to overcome for the enlargement of the European Union to Central Europe. So it is important to understand the main determinants of those Government interventions.
Accepting the framework presented in the introductory chapter of this book on the role of beliefs and values in agricultural policy formation, in this chapter we first will review the developments of government interventions on agricultural markets in Western Europe and identify the beliefs and values revealed by that evolution, as well as variations in these beliefs and values. There are indeed major differences in these across countries of the European Union, and they also vary through time, but this evolution is slow and relatively steady. As a result it is predictable, and this predictability offers us an intellectual handle to discuss the future of market interventions on agricultural markets in Western Europe. This will be the topic of the second part of this chapter.
The development of government intervention on agricultural markets in Western Europe reflects strong beliefs and values
There is no space in such a paper to do justice to all the details of the process of development and evolution of government intervention on agricultural markets in Western Europe. This history spans almost a century and actually it varies greatly from country to country^3. Yet a summary of this evolution will be useful here to reveal the beliefs and values underlying the development of those interventions, and to illustrate how those beliefs and values have actually affected policy development in this domain.

Major features of the evolution of agricultural market interventions
For this purpose it is useful to go back to the late nineteenth century when the development of transportation and the opening of new lands in North America and Oceania led to increased competition for agricultural production in Western Europe. Western European countries reacted very differently to these developments. The UK for instance was the first to liberalise, some said to sacrifice, its agriculture, with the repeal of the corn laws in the 1840s. By contrast, France and Germany decided to protect their agriculture. In the case of France this was heightened in the late 1870s, and during the 1880s. The German case was, of course, influenced by the use of the customs union, the 'Zollverein,' as an instrument to bring German political unification. Some countries chose an intermediate posture. Such are the cases of The Netherlands and Denmark, who decided to import grain freely, but to develop, on this basis, a livestock industry, which itself was somewhat protected and
geared to the growing export markets in the UK. and in Germany. These differences in the history of agricultural protection in the nineteenth century have had a lasting impact. And one can say that they continue to influence the attitudes of the various members of the European Union today. Thus, in recent debates, it is often the case that the UK and Dutch government representatives advocate trade liberalisation, reduction in price support, no quantitative restriction of production, and to let market mechanisms determine the levels of production. In France and Germany the support for higher level of price support has traditionally been strong, even if that meant the imposition of administrative restrictions on the volume of production.
In spite of these differences, it is striking that all Western European countries were led after World War I to adopt new policy instruments leading to direct government intervention in domestic markets. This is to be contrasted with the period of the late nineteenth century when the main debate, besides the level of the tariffs to be imposed on imports, was revolving around how to check the local monopoly power of private merchants through the creation of farmers co-operative and mutual credit organizations. The extraordinary situation of the inter-war period, with very low prices on agricultural markets accompanying the Great Depression, explains this new found uniformity. Clearly there remained significant differences from country to country in the precise instruments being used and in the level of government intervention. Yet it is striking that all countries adopted price support measures which were found everywhere to require government purchases on domestic markets
and the provision of storage facilities funded by the Government to ensure that the price support level was respected. In other words, the Government had to affect directly the domestic balance between supply and demand in order to ensure that market prices were indeed higher than, or a least equal to, the price support level decreed by Government. Note that these major policy innovations took place roughly at the same time in many countries, including outside Europe, particularly in the United States.
The destruction and disruptions caused by the Second World War of course changed the situation on domestic markets. The problem was then how to cope with scarcity, how to provide enough food to the population once outside supplies, particularly from North America, were cut off by the war. Everywhere the order of the day was to boost production in a period of rapid inflation. Therefore, price support was no longer an issue. After the Second World War, the main policy objective became economic reconstruction. This included agriculture and again the main task was to boost agricultural production. But soon, in the early 1950s, surpluses of agricultural products became more and more widespread and the main issue of the agricultural policy debate, particularly on the continent, was again how to support farm income through market interventions, without a cost to taxpayers, and sometimes to consumers, which would be unbearable. It is in this context that the common agricultural
policy of the new Common Market was developed.
The Rome Treaty, establishing the European Economic Community among six original Western European countries, (i.e., Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Italy) was actually the result of a protracted process of negotiations also involving several other countries. The idea of forging a larger community indeed faltered on disagreements regarding the desirable orientation of agricultural policies. The UK particularly did not want to adopt a policy of support to farm income through market interventions, because these were judged too risky in terms of potential budget costs. Note that because of its past policies, the UK had developed an agrarian structure, which was quite different from those on the continent, the liberalisation of the nineteenth century having led to a drastic reduction in the number of people working in agriculture. This permitted the emergence of large farms which turned out in the twentieth century to be more suited for mechanisation
and, therefore, to be more productive, and hence required less high prices in order to provide a decent income to farmers than those on the continent.
The development of the Common Agricultural Policy among the six original members of the Community took hard negotiations, however, and was indeed difficult. It eventually emerged as composed first of a system of market interventions funded by the so-called First Section of the European Fund for Orientation and Guarantee (FEOGA, according to its French acronym) which was essentially a pursuit at the Community level of the government interventions on agricultural markets which had been initiated in all member countries prior to the Second World War, as described earlier. Later on, these interventions on agricultural product markets were complemented by what are known as structural policies, essentially interventions in input markets, particularly land and labour. These structural policies were much slower to develop and required considerable debate because those policies proved more costly to the budget, and they provoked very serious internal conflicts within Western European
societies. Thus it was much more difficult to reach a consensus on those policies than it was on market intervention policies.
It is interesting to note that after the UK joined the European Economic Community, together with Ireland and Denmark in the early 1970s, the debate about me main features of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) was not reopened. The CAP was explicitly presented as part of what had been achieved in terms of construction of a Community by the six original members. This 'community achievement' was not to be re-opened for negotiations at the time of the entry of new members. Accordingly, the main instruments of government intervention on agricultural markets were left intact. It might be interesting to speculate what could have happened if the UK had been an original member of me Community. But this turned out to be a moot point.
The evolution of interventions under the Common Agricultural Policy has of course been important over the years. It has led to very bitter internal controversies, and many marathon sessions of the Council of Ministers in Brussels - at least once a year at the time of the so-called price review when the level of price support for the next crop year is being set. One can say, broadly speaking, that two major economic forces have determined the evolution of those market interventions, budget pressures on the one hand, and international trade liberalisation on the other. The main impact of budget pressures over 20 or 25 years has been the introduction of measures designed to reduce or limit the growth of government expenditures to finance those market interventions. This has included the establishment of coresponsibility levies, whereby producers are contributing to the funding of the cost of market interventions, and then measures designed to restrict the level of production.
This was done to reduce the growth of expenditures resulting from the fact that domestic supply grew faster than domestic demand plus potential exports on the world market. Because of government interventions, prices in the Community were traditionally higher than on world market, and, therefore, an export subsidy had to be paid to make exports possible. The first major measure limiting production was the establishment of milk quotas in 1984. It was followed in 1992 by provisions for land set-asides, i.e., limits to the areas devoted to the cultivation of various crops.
The second major economic force driving changes in the CAP has been the trends towards international trade liberalisation. This trend has been, of course, the result of outside pressures, culminating in the pressures from both the United States and the so-called Cairns group during the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations to include agriculture significantly in the negotiation. The 1992 reform of the CAP, which was briefly discussed above, was really the result of those outside pressures. It had become obvious to European policy makers that they had to adjust the CAP if they were to be able to reach an agreement with their trading partners in the Uruguay Round. This illustrates that the overriding economic objective of promoting general economic growth through general trade liberalisation prevailed over the sectoral interests of agriculture, which hoped to keep its protected status but failed to do so, at least as much as they would have liked.
The results of the Uruguay Round were that the European Commission agreed to engage into commitments regarding the use of trade distorting practices, namely it agreed to some limitation on the use of export subsidies, and to the conversion to tariffs of barriers to import. These tariffs are also committed to decline progressively. The result of those pressures domestically was, as indicated above, the limitation on cultivated areas for farmers who want to benefit from government measures and the de-coupling of those government payments. By de-coupling we mean here the fact that those government payments are not linked to the volume of production but are based on past production patterns. They are supposed to be payments made to compensate farmers for the losses incurred by the reduction in the level of price support and in the volume of production.
This very brief review of the evolution of government policies illustrates the hypothesis presented above that, in the long run, the evolution of market intervention policies is driven by long-term economic forces. But the differences in positions taken by the various member countries, themselves subjected to the same long-term economic forces, illustrate that government attitudes vary from country to country, and this is where social beliefs and values play an important role. This brief review also illustrates that as policies evolve through time, the sequence of events is important in shaping that evolution. For instance, the UK rejected major government interventions on agricultural markets prior to the Rome Treaty and refused to join the Community because of this issue. When they eventually joined, they had to accept those measures. One can speculate, as indicated above, on what would have happened if the sequence of the events had been different. Nobody really knows but
this very case illustrates me importance of the sequential nature of the process. This point could be demonstrated more clearly by a discussion of the process in more detail. This is beyond the scope of this paper, but it has been done by several authors in other publications (for instance, see Petit et al., 1987).
Revealed beliefs and values
What beliefs and values does the evolution of these government interventions on agricultural market reflect? The early measures designed to promote the development of marketing cooperatives in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries reflected the desire to check the monopoly power of local middle men and merchants. These measures were based on the beliefs that local merchants were cheating on quality of products and were exploiting their local monopoly power to charge high prices on the inputs which they sold and to pay unfairly low prices on the products which they purchased. These practices were seen as unfair, calling for remedies. This led to the adoption of various policy instruments, particularly measures promoting the development of cooperatives, but also the development of standards and grading systems as well as farmer marketing information systems. Generally speaking, one can say that those beliefs and values reflected an insufficient recognition of the
fact that middle men do play a socially useful function in a market economy. But the belief that economic agents when they enjoy some degree of market power will exploit it at the expense of producers and consumers certainly remains very widespread, and probably quite valid. It leads to the conviction that such behaviour is unfair, and that government interventions to restrict this market power are legitimate. This can be done through antitrust legislation and through the provision, as a public good, of better market information. The debate on such legislation, however, has changed over the years with the growing awareness that, in many sectors, there are gains to be made from exploiting economies of scale and, therefore, that large corporations, or large production units may be socially desirable. In addition, international trade liberalisation has established competition over much larger areas, leading to fewer concerns about local monopoly power. But even though beliefs
and values about market power are not as sharp as in the past, one can say that they continue to influence government intervention today.
The second set of beliefs and values revealed by the evolution of Western European government interventions on agricultural markets relates to price instability. There is a widespread belief that, unless they are somehow corrected, markets are inherently unstable. Because of the relatively low elasticities of supply and demand for agricultural products, particularly in the short run, small variations, or small shocks due to the weather or to other outside circumstances, lead to great price instability. This feature justifies government intervention because everybody suffers from instability. So a greater degree of price stability is seen as a potential public good. The difficulty faced by all Western societies with this set of beliefs and values is that it has led to unanticipated, practical consequences which have been rather negative. First of all, it has been very difficult to agree on, or even to detect, the long term trend in prices around which one should stabilise. As
a result, the policy making decision process has often been hijacked by agricultural interests which, under the guise of price stability, have in fact imposed price support policies at a level of support higher than the average or long term trend.
The second problem with government interventions to ensure price stability on domestic markets has been the cost of those interventions. In most cases, stability is achieved through public storage and the cost of maintaining stocks can become very high. Economists tend to point out these costs. However, the fact that policies leading to price stability have been maintained for long periods suggests that the beliefs and values underlying the position that price instability is bad and that it is worthwhile to expand resources to reduce it have remained quite strong in Western Europe, as reflected, for instance, in the debate among many European agriculturists regarding the need for some degree of protection for agriculture in developing countries.
Third, price support measures reflect clearly the belief that low prices for farmers are unfair and that measures to increase the average level of prices are justified. This is based on the conviction that competition from abroad is unfair. It is true that because of the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations measures have been taken that lead to a reduction in the level of price support in the European Union. But, it is probably fair to say that those reforms have been imposed by the international community. Yielding to these outside pressures has been seen widely in Europe as a price to pay for benefiting from global trade liberalisation, the benefits being understood as global but less clear-cut in the case of agriculture. Note that the idea that prices may be too low is related to the dynamics of change of agriculture in Western Europe. Agriculture is seen as having undergone profound transformation, farmers having been active participants in that process. Farmers are seen
as working hard, subjected to enormous pressures, and having made valiant efforts to adjust. And, this warrants the support of the public at large, since clearly these farmers' efforts have had a positive impact on society at large. They led to increased food security. In some countries, such as France, The Netherlands and Germany, the growth of agriculture has provided a significant sectoral surplus on the balance of trade. Finally it has helped ensure a generally high quality of food products. Admittedly, prices may be higher than they could be; yet they are seen as reasonable, and in any case they have declined in real terms over time.
But beliefs and values change through time: consequences for the future of market interventions
However slowly, beliefs and values change through time and space. These changes and their limitations can be seen first by considering the attitudes towards competition from abroad. As already indicated, there has been for a long time a significant difference of attitudes between continental countries and the UK, the latter having decided in the mid-nineteenth century, with me repeal of the corn laws, to submit its agriculture to the rigor of competition from abroad. At the same time, by contrast, several continental countries chose to protect their agriculture, particularly Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France.
The attitudes on the continent, however, have varied from country to country, and they certainly vary through time. This led in recent years to the widespread conviction that a 'fortress Europe' strategy would be impossible. This view that Europe needed to be part of the general world movement towards trade liberalisation had significant support outside of agriculture, everywhere in Western Europe. Regarding agriculture, trade conflicts with the United States, which have occurred in recent years and occupy the front pages of newspapers for a few days, often appear as ridiculous to the public at large. This was already true in the 1960s at the time of the so-called chicken war. The popular expression 'chicken war' itself is revealing of the derogatory tone of the comments from those who were not involved. The soybean embargo in the 1970s and later the disputes on corn-gluten feed or the boycott of French and Italian wines on US markets were always seen as unnecessary
skirmishes reflecting the ineptitude of governments unable to reach negotiated settlements. The political nature of the conflicts among countries, the seemingly small stakes involved compared to the high stakes of a common defence or common security arrangements, or even of the need to unite against terrorism, more recently, probably contributed to convincing public opinion that some kind of compromise on those issues would be more desirable, leading to the acceptance of the restrictions on domestic sovereignty regarding international trade of agricultural products which were made in the Uruguay round of the GATT. This has helped to convince Europeans at large that other instruments for supporting agriculture may be justified and called for.
It is interesting to note, however, that this change of values is brought about by a competing value regarding the appropriate place of Europe in the world, and particularly in international trade. The basic premise of government market intervention, namely that government measures to support the price level are legitimate, has not been challenged. This has been confirmed repeatedly by public opinion polls indicating that on the continent, at least, the main features of me Common Agriculture Policy were not questioned seriously.
A second aspect of changes in beliefs and values has to do with price instability and the use of better protection instruments. It is probably true that the underlying beliefs and values have been eroded, not so much because of the cost of storage, but because in the name of fighting instability, governments have found themselves in a position to change the balance between supply and demand, leading to surpluses which are difficult to export. Those surpluses have generally been seen as evidence of malfunctioning markets and market interventions. However, the very fact that exports are currently taxed because me world market price for some products has been above the decreed domestic price level, confirms that the attachment to price stability remains strong. If that were not the case, everybody would agree that Europe would be better off taking advantage of high prices on world markets by exporting.
Third, beliefs and values on die role of middle men and on their ability to exploit local monopoly powers certainly have changed since the last century when the first measures to limit their power of exploitation were introduced: Better communications, and better infrastructure have tended to eliminate the problem. There is a concern today that outlying rural areas are not properly served, and that there are not enough middle men. Thus, it is not the exploitation of middle men which is feared now. The objective situation has indeed changed. Markets are now extremely diversified - many farmers have formed co-operatives of various sorts; there is competition among those co-operatives and with private merchants. When several farmers are dissatisfied with the existing marketing channels, they tend to form new groups. In particular numerous initiatives have been taken recently to market specific, high quality products from small geographic areas of origin which are assumed to
have more character, and, thus, to be of higher quality. As a result the issue of exploitation of market power does not attract the attention which it did in the past.
By contrast, the emergence of a new set of beliefs and values regarding the environment, the use of land, the spatial distribution of activities, as they affect rural landscapes and more generally the role of agriculture in the management of natural resources, is striking. One probably can argue that in fact a new social contract may be in the process of emerging on this score. Public opinion at large seems to be willing to pay for environmental amenities, e.g., some conservation of the landscapes in specific areas. This explains why, in some instances, local communities pay farmers to cut grass in mountain areas to prevent the risk of avalanches. In some regions, or some member states of the European Union, authorities intervene and provide farmers with subsidies to compensate them for restrictions on their practices in order to reduce pollution, for instance, or to enhance some environmental purpose. Other measures have been taken also in the name of protecting the
environment at the national, and at the Union level. The expression of a 'new social contract' used above reflects the fact that those public moneys are not devoted just to support agriculture. They are provided in exchange for specific services or in compensation for specific restrictions on the use of land placed on farmers. In this respect, the emergence of these values seems to be widespread in Western Europe. It is clearly more intense in some places than in others. The Swiss example (although Switzerland is not a member of the European Union) comes to mind. There, the restrictions in some cantons, brought about by public referenda, are very severe. But that same movement takes other shapes in other countries. In France for instance, the identification of local culture, the production of local products with a clear geographic origin is certainly an evidence of this new set of beliefs and values. It is quite clear that concerns associated with those issues are going to
carry more and more weight in the policy debate regarding agriculture, including market interventions. Of course, me latter tend to be more general than the measures regarding the environment and the management of natural sources, which are inspired by this new set of beliefs and values. But the debate on the environmental costs of agricultural intensification, which is now very lively, will undoubtedly influence the future of market interventions.
In addition, the emergence of a new social contract leads to questions regarding the overall allocation of public moneys to agriculture. (See for instance a recent issue of the review Economic Rurale, entirely devoted to 'direct payments to farmers' (Economic Rurale, 233, May-June 1996). In this context, one can predict that the large compensatory payments, which were part of the 1992 reform, to offset the impact on farmers income of reduced levels of price support, are probably not socially and politically sustainable for many years at their current level.
In conclusion
It is clear that beliefs and values have played an important role in the evolution of government intervention on agricultural markets in Western Europe. The exact mechanism whereby this role is being played can only be hypothesised, and an approach has been suggested above; but there is no doubt about the importance of this role. What is clear also is that those beliefs and values change through time in ways that are not fully understood, but which have to do with long-term changes in public opinion and perceptions. These are obviously related to better education and to greater awareness of the bad, unintended consequences of some policies.
The pollution of water tables resulting from intensification of agriculture, particularly from large concentrations of livestock, is an example of such an unintended policy consequence, which has an impact on the beliefs and values underlying the policies concerned. Predicting what changes will occur and how they will influence future policy directions will remain a challenging task because of our limited understanding of how beliefs and values affect policies, and of the mechanisms which determine how those beliefs and values evolve. But it is clear that, in the future, market intervention policies will continue to evolve because of changes in beliefs and values.
Beliefs and values regarding government intervention in agriculture and food prices: A commentary - Case of the Czech republic
by Tomas Doucha
Recently I have had the opportunity to speak with representatives of the government and the Agrarian Chamber, with top managers of big farms and family farmers, and with different professionals as well. The main topic of our discussions was government intervention: if government intervenes, what should be the level of intervention and which instruments should be used. In the Czech Republic these issues have a political urgency because of the shifts in social and economic policies since 1989. Many believe current policies have deep roots that go back to the communist period. My comments on "Beliefs and Values Regarding Government Intervention" is written from the perspective of the Czech Republic, which shares a fate of interrupted development punctuated with periods of revolutionary change with the other Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries.
The comments that follow reflect my personal opinions, enriched by the discussions referred to earlier and by intense discussion with close friends and family. These are my personal opinions and do not represent any official position or policy.
Preliminary statements
∑ Because of the heritage of the regimes in the Czech Republic before reforms, the role of the state in agriculture cannot be isolated now from the role of the state in the whole society and in the national economy.
∑ In discussing the state, for our purposes we will differentiate between the government (elected, e.g., every four years) and the state bureaucracy.
∑ Development without continuity punctuated with periods of revolutionary change leads to homogeneous beliefs and values in a society that are only temporary. During periods of revolutionary change ideology surmounts reality.
∑ When a society undergoes major reform, new social and economic interests develop, gradually causing previously homogeneous beliefs and values to diverge.
∑ Because many emerging market countries have underdeveloped social infrastructure, these countries tend to be more vulnerable to the activities of better organised, more informed and educated interest groups and to the loss of the social utility function.
∑ One of the most educated and informed interest groups is the state. The government aims to be re-elected and the bureaucracy intends to maintain or increase its power. This is particularly evident in the agriculture sector.
∑ In this context, the state plays an ambiguous role in the development of the country. The state is gradually reducing controls in various areas in the agricultural sector (e.g., production quotas, use of inputs) while it is struggling to increase its power and control of the market.
∑ Agriculture is supported both visibly and invisibly. As a rule, beliefs and values are linked only with the visible supports.
∑ The transformation and reconstruction in agriculture have proceeded substantially quicker than the same processes in other sectors of the national economy (capitalistic agriculture is surrounded by a post-socialist structure).
∑ Agricultural policy in the first stage of reform (1989-1995) reflects beliefs and values concerning the weak position of agriculture in the markets and the unfair income of farmers. By the second stage of reform (after 1995), agricultural policy reflects more beliefs and values concerning consumers and the stability of the market.
∑ The concept of public goods in agriculture is beginning to develop.
∑ The farm sector does not share a homogeneous structure (as it does in Western countries), and it is also perceived by the society in that way.
The situation before reform
Because of its history, the Czech Republic has a rich experience with the role of the state as the main factor providing or influencing the social utility function. In the previous communist regime there was a supposition that only a state led by the communist party was able to provide an optimum social utility value. The state prevailed in all spheres, including the market^4. In principle, the generally perceived societal beliefs and values supported the idea of the almighty state. The state was controlled by one political force - the communist party. The selective character of party membership determined the social stratification of the society. It also contributed to the reality that beliefs and values were not held in the society homogeneously.
^4However, Marxist theory understood the role of the almighty state as only a temporary phenomenon.
Any imperfections within the society or the market the public perceived as a natural part of the development of the system and were associated with the asymmetrical distribution of wealth and power that came from imperfect central, directive controls. The perception was that any problem could be centrally and directly remedied. The main approach to resolution was improving central control.
The reform forces saw the diminishing role of the state and the introduction of a free market and plural democracy as a solution to flaws in the system. One example often referred to is the situation in the 1960s with its peak in The Prague Spring of 1968. However, when we evaluate our reform experiments, it is necessary to consider that the main pillar in beliefs and values during the communist regime was a conscious feeling (sometimes more a powerless feeling) that it was not possible to change the regime nor to substitute it with a Western democracy. The mostly passive resistance or schweik^5 behaviour of common people corresponded to this feeling. Some people did not accept this passivity and actively resisted. They were often physically 'liquidated' in the 1950s, persecuted in work in the 1970s, or found themselves outside the society - they became dissidents.
^5 Jaroslav Hasek, a famous Czech writer, wrote the book The Good Soldier Schweik just after World War I. Schweik has become a synonym for the behaviour, often seen as typical of the Czech population, of appearing to go along with authorities that are foreign or hostile to common people (e.g., Austrian, German, Russian and communist authorities in the last two centuries), in a reasonable way. The behaviour combines a pretended obedience and naivete with the very healthy common sense of the Czech people. It means a mixture of a passive and an active resistance to hostile authorities.
The more technocratic forces of the society wanted to amend the system by a more perfect monitoring of the economy and by applying mathematical instruments to model a societal and market 'equilibrium.' The rapid development of information systems and computers contributed to this orientation. In this connection there were never-ending struggles to build and introduce hierarchical management information systems (in the CEE countries: Automatic Control Systems).
During the period preceding reform, the state decided which sectors of society and the economy would receive preference. Agriculture (fully in the hands of co-operatives and state farms) became a 'permanently preferred' sector; meanwhile, the state also 'permanently' supported consumers by relatively low food prices. These and similar policy decisions depended upon a huge redistribution process in which economic criteria had no priority. In addition to the permanent deterioration of the national economy (particularly compared to the growth of national economies in the Western countries) these redistribution programmes had a special effect - the state developed sophisticated know-how which it used to train its bureaucrats. This experienced bureaucracy, as we shall see later, has played an important role even after 1989.
The velvet revolution and the first stage of reform
In 1989, there were new opportunities available of which people could only dream before. The population seemed to develop a common set of beliefs and values very quickly:
∑ Get rid of the old system, old structures and old international commitments, as quickly as possible.
∑ Live in a democratic, pluralistic society in order to have real freedom.
∑ Increase substantially the standard of living, with the understanding that there might be a temporary period of 'belt tightening'.
∑ Become an integral part of a developed, democratic Europe -become a member of the EU.
Since the beginning of reform, a consensus prevailed about how a commonly shared set of beliefs and values could be attained. Practically, this meant removing state control of the society ('the king is dead'), privatising the national economy, and moving to a more market-oriented economy. The consequences of these steps, including the rise of previously unknown social or class distinctions, people perceived as positive.
The goals of the first stage of reform (1989-1995) were:
∑ Complete formal privatisation.
∑ Develop a new structure of firms and entrepreneurs.
∑ Introduce a new social structure characterised by a new distribution of income and wealth.
These objectives were completed successfully in a very short time with great acclaim. However, the rapidity with which these goals were met was, to some extent, offset by what was perceived as unfair results. An absence of laws on conflicts of interest, on regulation of the 'shadow economy,' combined with gaps in financial market regulation contributed to the 'unfair results.'^6
^6 Perhaps this absence existed because laws and regulations would have formed an obstacle to rapid progress.
It is symptomatic of the overall situation that these problems occurred (despite the repeated warnings of then-President Vaclav Havel, among others, of the need to apply moral principles in the reform process) at this stage of the reform. People perceived these inequalities as an inevitable tax paid for the rapid progress made during reform. The unfair results were also in accord with the beliefs and values prevailing at the beginning of the reform.
While privatisation and the market (price) liberalisation occurred relatively quickly, the reduction of state intervention in the society and the national economy have gone forward with delay and hesitation. The government set itself a goal of transforming the national economy while maintaining social peace. Society was persuaded that it was entering an unconstrained free market paradise, but in reality, the maintenance of the social peace was conditioned on the less visible, but still strong, influence of the state on the national economy. The state maintained a significant share in the most important sectors and firms (banks, certain industries, e.g., elevators, etc.). Many sectors of the economy (which affected a large part of household expenditures) remained strictly regulated, including non-tradable goods (housing/rent, energy, heating, water).
The prevailing ideology of an almighty free market led to a paradoxical situation. While the production capacities and the market of 'traditional' private goods (including food) were mainly left under strong state control, the privatisation process and the free market was encouraged in the sectors in which there was a public interest or in which natural monopolies existed - health care, education, culture, transportation and energy.
The state still prevails in many spheres, and as in the past, in a central - and sometimes ad hoc - manner with one improvisation. One could say that the state has brought to perfection the old, centrally-based system, having used it up to the maximum.^7
^7 For example: (a) the administrative split of the country into the Czech and Slovak Republics in 1993, which the majority of the people evaluated as negative, and (b) the hesitation of the state to implement a new national governmental structure - one with regions of the country linked by a decentralised national or state power.
From another point of view, we can call the result of the first stage of the reform 'nomenclature capitalism.' The interests of the state bureaucracy and parts of the private sector are linked. This feature is more obvious at the beginning of the second stage of the reform, characterised by the very discernible property concentration and the concentration of economic power with all real and potential consequences that could result from this arrangement. It may be only a matter of time until the 'real' economic power decides to break its links with the state and maximise profits at any public cost, regardless of the desire of the government to maintain the social peace. At the beginning of the reform, the populace shared basic beliefs and values; it is becoming less clear where there is consensus. A desire for more social justice has started to prevail. The results of the last elections in 1996 undoubtedly reflected these changes and shifts in the perceptions, beliefs and
values of the people.
During the first stage of the reform the government continued to support agriculture -albeit at a lower level than before 1989. The government tried fast to support a policy that maintained that agriculture is a sector like every other sector. It needed no specific measures to protect it. Nevertheless, in subsequent years support for agriculture was rationalised by the major decline in demand for agricultural products and food after the abolition of the direct food price subsidies and after price liberalisation, which resulted in the opening of the price scissors for agriculture. Another argument for agricultural support was connected with the deterioration of the market position of farmers during a period of extremely high agricultural surpluses. At that time only the first steps toward privatisation and the dismantling of the state monopoly in the up-stream and down-stream sectors had occurred.
All public opinion surveys demonstrate the continued willingness of the citizens to support agriculture. However, the public perceives only the visible part of supports from taxpayers, not the invisible support from customers, that are much higher as a rule.
The visible supports were dramatically reduced, especially after 1992. This approach of the government has been criticised by farmers, of course. The criticism concerned not only the level of supports, but also their instability. The Czech farmers argued by comparing their position with that of farmers in developed countries with generous agricultural policies, particularly those in the EU.
The invisible part of the supports from consumers is disclosed by the Producer Subsidy Equivalent (PSE) calculated according to the OECD methodology. Using this indicator the invisible supports accounted for up to 75 percent of all supports in 1994, representing in nominal terms the amount of about 15-16 bio CZK per year, or about 1500-1600 CZK per capita per year. How the citizens would react if they had this information at their disposal is questionable.
Czech agriculture is not a homogeneous sector as it is in the Western countries, and it is not perceived as such by the society. In the fast stage of the reform, there was a question of splitting agriculture into two parts: non-privatised and non-transformed farms, and newly established and already transformed farms.
The legal transformation concerned only the co-op farms. The discussions on the transformation and restitution laws became an arena for conflicts between quite different opinions on the substance (position) of co-ops and, from this, on the substance of farming itself. These opinions ranged from the conception of co-ops as fully private entities to the identification of co-ops as full state entities. A compromise was accepted by the parliament, one that is more disadvantageous for co-ops and one that reflects the desire for a political, rather than an economic decision on the future of co-ops. The discussions on the law took place in the fast years of the reform when a nostalgic view of farm structure (original peasantry with very small farms) prevailed.
A very important political consequence of the transformation of co-ops is the fact that millions of citizens became co-owners or rather creditors of newly-established (transformed) co-ops. This newly-created legal linkage of a large number of the population with agriculture is a factor to be considered when we evaluate beliefs and values of the government, political parties and citizens towards agriculture today and in the near future.
Nevertheless, a belief in the vitality of collective farming has started to prevail in the society citing the advantages of large-scale production and the social aspects of the co-op movement. Of course, both aspects can be met by substituting other types of fanning as the critics of co-ops have stated, pointing to past behaviour of members and the continuing lower labour productivity in co-ops. The second group of farms form large-scale private farms, coming largely from the privatisation of the previous state farms. These farmers are really industrial entrepreneurs, as a rule, using hired labour and strictly using the profit criteria. The third big group of farms form smaller and small enterprises established, as a rule, on the basis of restitution and family farming.
At the beginning of the reform, the state supported establishing and stabilising family farms (which corresponds with the nostalgic phase of the reform). After completing the transformation of co-ops, support was available (without discrimination) to all legal forms of farming.^8
^8 Co-ops that had been transformed could qualify for support only if they had met their restitution obligations.
For the further development of Czech agriculture it is very important that each of the present groups of farms and farmers - transformants, privatisants, restituents - takes over into the future the high and specific debts and obligations (towards the state, citizens, other farms, banks). A strict economic assessment of this situation could suggest Czech agriculture as a sector potentially going into bankruptcy. The government is now considering the problem of what to do with this indebtedness, whether any help would be offered, in which way and to whom. The first suggestions of the government are neutral at least, considering help (e.g., writing off all or part of debts) to be acceptable to all groups of farms.
Start the second stage of the reform
There were some significant shifts at the beginning of the second stage of the reform after 1995 and after the elections in 1996. Property concentration has started in the upstream and down-stream sectors (linked with the 'second wave of privatisation'). This concentration also enabled by the state, which has started to get rid of (sell) its shares in these sectors. Now there is a certain equilibrium between supply and demand on the agricultural market, and food prices - following the changes on the world market as well -show a tendency to increase more quickly than the prices of other goods and services, pushing the rate of inflation up. Under these conditions the government is looking for measures to lower inflation and protect consumers, to the detriment of farmers.
So on the one hand, the government is abandoning more direct control of key enterprises, and on the other hand, it is intent upon seizing responsibility for certain markets (e.g., cereals market), using the instruments of a state semi-monopoly. The idea is particularly supported by the state bureaucracy ('the king is dead, long live the king!'). Farmers very carefully consider priorities: if they prefer a more liberal market forming new opportunities and (obviously short-term) higher profits, or if they should prefer a stable market, with a state guarantee of a satisfactory level of prices. It seems that farmers want to be back in a regime with fixed state offers for their production and with guaranteed prices. The Common Agricultural Policy of the EU is a big incentive for this position.
Some governmental officials believe that the market infrastructure (food chains) is imperfect, that it does not generate trustworthy information, and that the food chains are managed (controlled) by 'bad people' against the interests of both farmers and consumers. The magic circle is almost closed: the state will intervene substantially in the agricultural market because of the imperfections of food chains, and it is going to apply measures preventing the needed healthy development of food chains. However, not all governmental officials and members of the Parliament agree.
The Czech food chain will have to go through a further restructuring. The arguments of the government on the protection of farmers against the up-stream and down-stream sectors are to some extent already out of date. The processors have one big weakness - over-capacities. With these over-capacities and with the decline of agricultural production, the market power on some segments of the market is on the side of farmers at present (probably only temporarily). Farmers have managed to organise quickly to force their interests against processors. An example is the establishment of co-ops for purchase and distribution of milk from producers and dairies. It is symptomatic that these co-ops became an object of interest of the anti-monopoly authority and that several co-ops were even penalised (but not liquidated). On similar principles and for similar purposes, farmers concentrate then-property shares to acquire joint stock companies in the down-stream sector.
The decision regarding which agricultural policy will be finally accepted for the second stage of reform is a task for the coming months. I hope that new policy will aim at maximising the social utility function more than at satisfying interests of any lobby, not excluding - as I tried to explain before - the state.
Without doubt farmers will try to transform the policy into an 'Agricultural Law.' However, our society is missing a long term vision, not only for agriculture. I think that one of our main duties is to start thinking, formulating and evaluating the possible options and visions, to prepare our society for more fundamental decisions about agriculture, respecting its new roles.
Group discussion on "Beliefs and values regarding government intervention in markets"
There was a discussion of the values that appear to be driving agricultural polices in the Central European countries. One value is that private fanning structure is preferable and that agriculture should not be considered as being different from other industries. However, there is a conflicting view in some quarters that the large scale farms under the old system had advantages, including a better social support system. Thus, despite an initial push in most countries to go back to small farms and peasant agriculture, in most countries the system has evolved with a mixture of types of farms.
Most producers in Central Europe are demanding greater price stability as they have been faced with declining demand for food as food subsidies were removed and they have been squeezed between rising input costs and stable or lower farm prices. However, whereas in the EU price stabilisation programmes have been turned into income transfer programmes, in Central Europe there simply are not enough resources to undertake significant income transfers. Therefore, whatever income transfers occur come from border protection and not in the form of direct transfers from government.
In most countries there is suspicion of middlemen and processors. Farmers feel that they have no market power, and agricultural bureaucrats stand ready to engage in market control and intervention in the name of equity.
It was pointed out that there appears to be greater uniformity in the beliefs and values regarding government intervention in Western Europe than in Central Europe. It was agreed that this greater uniformity leads to more coherent policies and wide support for agricultural policies.
The history of government intervention in markets in Western Europe seems to be efforts by the government to adjust markets and market forces to the farm structures. In the United States and to a large extent in Central Europe, much of the policy is aimed at helping farms and other parts of the sector adjust to the market. One exception to this trend is some of the activities described in the Czech Republic which are attempting to adjust markets to fit structures that are in transition.
It was pointed out mat new values were coming into force in the EU which are bringing new sets of government intervention. These are values relating to conservation and environment where policies pay farmers to change production practices, maintain green space, and protect me rural environment. This is a case where government policies are being used to adjust agriculture to the perceived market for public goods (environmental services) rather than to adjust markets to reflect the values of farm producers. This appears to represent a new social contract relating to agriculture. As yet the demand for these public goods has not appeared in Central Europe and, thus, they have not yet moved in this policy direction.

Appendix to chapter 5
Improving the income of farmers and rural people
by Leszek Klank
Agriculture always was a very sensitive political issue in all communist countries, including Poland. The agricultural issue was even more important in Poland than in other communist countries because the largest private sector among all communist countries was in Polish agriculture. It had real political power. All major political changes in Poland after World War II were connected, directly or indirectly, with food and agriculture. The problems which arose in feeding the nation in the years of crisis forced subsequent governments to modify the goals of their agricultural policy.
Until 1980, the principal goal of agricultural policy in Poland was to achieve the highest possible rate of farm output growth. After 1980, this goal was changed to achieving self-sufficiency in farm and food products. After 1989, the main goal of agricultural policy was changed again, this time to provide off-farm employment for farmers and rural people. During this entire period farmers' incomes were the most important issue both for farmers and decision makers. Both farmers and politicians believed that by solving the income issue, they could solve all other problems associated with the sector.
Principles of income policies
For many decades farmers and politicians, acting as their representatives, have been calling for farmers' incomes to be equal to those of other social groups. The demand to earn equal incomes is based on the concept of equal opportunities for all social and occupational groups and was heard before World War II. In Poland it also had a very strong religious and ideological background. The concept was referred to as parity.
This concept became the foundation of one of the most fundamental principles of income policy in agriculture. It was defined for the first time in the USA in 1933 legislation as a way to measure prices that would provide farmers with a 'fair' income.^1 These 'parity' prices were based on the belief that parity prices would provide farmers with fair incomes. Parity prices were defined as those prices that would provide the same ratio of prices received by farmers to prices paid by farmers for products used in production and living as the ratio between August 1909 and July 1914. It was assumed that if farmers received parity prices for their products, it would yield enough net income that the relation between incomes per head of population in farm households and non-farm households would be as favourable as during the base period.
^1Black, J.D.: Parity, parity, parity. Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1942.
The adoption of this concept of price parity did not mean, however, that the incomes of farmers and non-farmers would be equal. In the base period, American farmers were receiving only 67 percent of the per capita income of non-farmers.^2 The parity price principle only tended to prevent increased disparity between incomes in farm households and non-farm households due to declining relative prices for farm products.
^2Hams, C.C.: Parity income prices. Journal of Farm Economics 1962 Vol. XIV No. 7.
Leaving aside the issue of achieving the goal of parity prices, in fact, it meant that the goal became one of having incomes of farmers and non-farmers increase at the same rate. It was a major contribution to the process of defining income principles for agriculture in many advanced industrial countries, as well as in Poland.
The next very important concept which influenced income policy in agriculture was introduced in the USA in 1936. It was the concept of parity income defined as income necessary to maintain the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms and that of the income of persons not on farms that prevailed during the five year period August 1909 to July 1914. In 1948 parity income was redefined as the gross farm income necessary to guarantee the standard of living in farm households equal to persons dependant on other occupations. Many scientists talk about parity between incomes of farmers and non-farmers if the levels of welfare for the two groups are equal. In other words, parity means that a welfare level of a person or group, dependent on income, is the same for farm households and non-farm households. The difference between income received and parity income is called income disparity. It can be either relative or absolute.
Over time there was an evolution from the principle of parity prices to the principle of equal living conditions for farmers and non-farmers. Thus, the history of agricultural income policy in advanced industrial countries saw three goals of income policy, namely: 1) a goal of stable price ratios for farm products fixed at some historical period; 2) a goal of parity incomes, that is an equal level of incomes; and 3) a goal of parity living conditions, that is of equal living standards for different social and occupational groups. However, there is a possible fourth option, no income policy.
Most developed, industrial countries, as well as Poland, tried to implement their income policies for agriculture using the changing objectives. Poland, for instance, adopted two principles of income policies for agriculture, especially towards private farmers (on state farms and later in co-operatives the principles of incomes policies were similar to those in industrial state enterprises). In 1956, a so-called new agricultural policy introduced the principle of equal rate of growth of incomes for farm and non-farm households. At that time the relation between a farmer's income and that of a full-time employee in other sectors of the economy amounted to 75 percent. It is obvious that that principle would maintain relative differences in incomes and lead to increases in absolute differences in incomes. Farmers would be at a disadvantage from the beginning. But, in fact, their incomes increased much faster than non-farmers' incomes. Until 1981, when the principle of equal
rate of growth of incomes was replaced by another concept, the relation between incomes of the two groups was much higher than at the beginning. Even in 1980, which was a very bad year for Polish agriculture due to bad crops, the relation of farm to non-farm income was equal to 84.2 percent, and in 1978-79 it amounted to 90 and 93 percent, respectively. Between 1981 and 1984, relative incomes of farm population were near parity, that is, the relation between incomes of farmers and non-farmers was almost equal to one. One has to remember that in these calculations off-farm incomes were not taken into account.
In introducing the parity income formula for agriculture, Polish politicians believed that:
∑ It would be the best measure of the income situation of farm households.
∑ By achieving parity of incomes, food shortage issues would be solved. As a result of the latter, the social tensions would be eliminated.
They did not care that it was not easy to define income parity or that theoretical definitions present many problems. In practice notions which are understandable and easy to use were adopted.
The early 1980s brought essential changes in income policy in Poland towards private farms. The principle of equal rate of income growth was replaced by the principle of parity incomes, which meant equal incomes for farmers and non-farmers. This principle was thus very similar to those followed by EEC.
The adoption of parity income policy in 1981 in Poland was not successful. It was introduced together with a policy of increasing prices at the time of severe decline in the production of agricultural products (1989) and chaos on the market. The decision to implement the principles was both economic and political. With this move politicians hoped to bring about an increase in the scope and volume of agricultural production. However, at that time, as well as in 1982, there was no longer any connection between prices and goods on the market. The purchase price of agricultural products increased 67 percent, whereas the price of consumer goods for farmers increased only 28 percent. This caused farmers' incomes to rise above parity. The relation of income for consumption in a farm household to that of a full-time employee in a non-farm household was 90 percent in 1981. The following year it increased to 106 percent, and in 1983 it amounted to 99 percent. Since 1983, the
difference between incomes of farmers and non-farmers has been decreasing. In 1989, it was around 84 percent. In August 1989, the government formally stopped following the principle of parity incomes. The introduction of market prices, as demanded by farmers, resulted in a rise in incomes for a short period.
In the last quarter of 1989 the nominal income per head of population in a farm household was 33 percent higher than in non-farm households. This situation did not last for long, and in the second quarter of 1991, farmers' incomes were at the bottom in comparison to other social and occupational groups in Poland. In 1994 and 1995, the ratio of farmers' to non-farmers' incomes was 87.6 and 91.3 percent, respectively. On the whole, the new economic policy did not provide any income policy for agriculture. The agricultural policy was based on the principles of market economy.
Comparison of relative incomes
When comparing incomes of farm and non-farm populations, researchers usually take into account total incomes, that is the amount per physical person (or per capita) instead of the amount per full-time employee. The adoption of this basis of calculation results mainly from the difficulty in establishing the number of full-time employees, especially in agriculture. Many researchers claim that it is better to compare real figures than calculated ones as the former are more likely to be error-free. Moreover incomes expressed per head of population have a different economic interpretation from the same incomes expressed per full-time employee.
As mentioned, income parity is perceived basically as the principle of equal incomes. We can ask whether this principle is valid. From the point of economy it is justified only when equal payment is provided for equal work. In other words, incomes are equal when productivity is equal.
However, productivity in agriculture is usually lower than in other sectors of the economy. For example, in Poland the labour productivity in agriculture is about one-third the average in the non-farm economy.
Moreover, differences in incomes within agriculture raise doubts and questions regarding the principle of income parity. Hence the next question: does achieving income parity in agriculture mean equal incomes and equal satisfaction for all farmers? The answer is no because:
∑ Farmers are usually not aware of what parity is. What they, in fact, want are not equal incomes, but maximum incomes. If they compare their situations with those of workers in other sectors of the economy, they compare living conditions and not incomes. It appears that the principle of parity has more importance to politicians than to farmers.
∑ Differences between incomes within agriculture are usually greater than in other sectors of the economy. In many countries a small percentage of farms have very high levels of production and incomes. In other words, the concentration of incomes within farming in these countries is very high. As a result, many farmers with lower incomes are not satisfied with their income situation, even though on the average the agricultural sector receives income parity. Thus, achieving parity has little to do with achieving equal incomes.
∑ Because of the difficulties in obtaining proper data on incomes, the income parity concept can be subject to political manipulations. In the 1980s, Poland experienced such manipulations.
∑ Implementation of the income policy which is based on a parity formula can be very expensive in case of very low efficiency in agriculture. In other words, achieving parity incomes will require large money transfers from taxpayers or consumers to farmers.
The previous discussion shows that income parity may be defined in a number of different ways; moreover we can measure it using various methods. One of the pioneer works in this respect was done by J. R. Bellerby^3, an English economist. Before World War II he measured relations between incomes in twenty countries using the concept of the ratio of the farmers' incentive income. According to his definition, the income ratio is the relation between the incentive income per man equivalent of a person employed in agriculture and the incentive income per man of the other sectors of the economy. Incentive income meant the return for the worker's effort and his undertaking. In agriculture this was defined as the total factor income after the deduction of the net rent, interest costs and wages paid to agricultural workers.
^3 Bellerby, J.R.: Agriculture and Industry - Relative Income. McMillan and Co.. London, New York 1956.
Bellerby's research on the incentive income ratios in the agriculture of Great Britain during the periods between 1867-69 and 1911-14 and between 1923-29 and 1936-38 showed a very big difference in this ratio in the periods considered. In fact, the income incentive ratio, which was up from 35.5 percent in 1892-96 to 81.1 percent in 1933-1935. The lower ratio in the first period was due to the recession in agriculture in 1880s and early 1890s, increasing competitiveness from overseas agriculture, and very low prices for wheat. During the second period, the relatively more favourable agricultural situation was due to the great economic depression between 1929 and 1933, which brought low incomes in non-farm sectors of the economy and high protection for agriculture. The subsidisation of wheat producers begun in 1932, and the 1931 and 1933 legislation enabled farmers to form marketing boards.
In 1938, Bellerby reported his first international research using 28 countries. He grouped them into five sets on the basis of the probable real incentive income ratio. The first group composed of only four countries, Australia, New Zealand, France and China, had the highest ratio, over 75 per cent; the second group with a ratio of between 60 and 75 percent had six countries, among them Great Britain; the third group, with a 45 to 60 percent ratio, included Sweden and Canada; the fourth group composed of the USA and The Netherlands, with a ratio of 35 to 45 percent; and the last group with a ratio below 35 percent, included Egypt and Mexico. On the basis of his research, Bellerby claimed that there was no positive correlation between the level of economic development and relative incomes of farm households.
To verify Bellerby's claim, we have used FAO data and a formula, which is the relationship between the share of the agricultural GDP and the GDP of other economic sectors divided by the share of agricultural population to non-agricultural population.
FAO data in Appendix Table 1A shows that in 1980 only seven percent and in 1961 approximately two percent of the countries under examination recorded parity or incomes above parity in farm households. (Please see Appendix at the end of this chapter.) The unweighted average of the countries concerned was 41.2 percent of parity in 1980. In approximately 30 percent of cases the relation between the farmers' and non-farmers' income was not higher than 20 per cent, irrespective of the period analysed. The countries with the income parity for the two groups included the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, the former German Democratic Republic, and, surprisingly, Ghana, Kampuchea and Cuba. Assuming that the statistical data of the latter three countries are reliable, we can conclude that the income parity is incidental and is the result of some specific social and economic or political conditions.
In the present analysis the most interesting relations are those between the national income and the relative incomes of farm households, as well as those between the economic growth and the increases in relative incomes. It should be pointed out that these relations are also affected by other factors. To measure the relationships the coefficients of simple correlation have been used. The correlation coefficient between the per capita GDP and the relative incomes has been calculated as follows:
∑ 1961 r= 0.663 R^2 = 0.440
∑ 1980 r= 0.464 R^2 = 0.215
They turned out to be statistically significant with a very high probability level: p = 0.999.
It should be noted that the correlation between the level of economic development and relative incomes was higher in 1961 than in 1980. However, even in 1961 the relative incomes were affected far more by factors other than economic growth. A study based on 1980 data showed very little relationship between the two. In 1980, only just over one-fifth of the relative income variation was associated with the level of economic development. These results demonstrate that the relative incomes and the economic growth are not highly correlated.
The next analysis examined the correlation between economic growth and the changes in the farmers' relative incomes. In other words, does economic growth produce income parity between the farm households and the non-farm households? Based on the same FAO statistical data source for 1961 and 1980, a correlation was calculated between two variables: a) the rate of economic growth, measured as increase in per capita GDP; and b) the increase in relative incomes, defined as the point difference between the periods analysed.
The coefficient of correlation between the two factors amounted to r = -0.103 and turned out to be not statistically significant. In other words, there is no correlation between the economic growth and the increase in the relative income of the farm households. Many scientists, among them E.O. Heady, claim that the economic growth even worsens the relative economic position of farm households.
This assertion may be correct, but it is the relative income that declines and not the absolute income level. Economic growth produces income increases for all social groups, but not at the same rate. Increases in farmers' incomes may be slower than some of the other social and occupational groups. Our analysis shows this as a general tendency all over the world. However, the opposite can be observed in some countries.

Ways of improving incomes in agriculture
Economic development and income in agriculture
The relation between the level of economic development and the relative incomes between agriculture and other sectors of the economy is a complex phenomenon. It is affected, among other factors, by a country's economic policies toward particular population groups (social and occupational). The distribution of income among groups, and later within them, is influenced not only by economic, but also by ideological, political, psychological, and social factors. Hence, income parity can be achieved both by political decisions, as in most socialist countries, and by economic development.
Different approaches related to the agricultural incomes in particular countries can be demonstrated by the level of 'reward' of the labour efficiency, that is by the relation between the national income (GNP) per agricultural worker and the final agricultural output per agricultural worker. Research conducted by the Institute of Rural and Agricultural Development of the Polish Academy of Sciences shows that agricultural labour efficiency was rewarded relatively better in the communist countries than in other countries. However, the range of the "reward" within the industrial countries was rather broad, with the exception of the nations where the efficiency in agriculture was very high. Using the reward in the USA in 1985 as 100, the following figures are obtained.
A comparison of these figures leads to the conclusion that the agricultural policies of almost all communist countries were primarily socially oriented. In developed capitalist countries, where the agricultural productivity is high, the income policies correlated better with the economic performance in agriculture than in the communist countries. However, this does not mean that all capitalist countries follow the same agricultural income policies.
According to the Hungarian economist B. Csikos-Nagy, "The full success in the fight with price and income disparity is a historical process, which is closely connected with the integration of agriculture and industry, higher level of agricultural yields, and intensive development in agricultural production. Thus, the reason for the living conditions of the farm population approximating those of the non-farm population is not the development of industry, which improves the material condition of the city dwellers, but better conditions of work in agriculture. Incomes of farmers and peasants can reach parity only when the primitive conditions of their work undergo thorough transformations. Economic and price policies can accelerate this process. Those who think that the issue can be solved entirely by political decisions are mistaken."^4
^4Csikos-Nagy, B.: Socialist price theory and price policy. Akademiai Kiado. Budapest 1985.
Many economists agree with that the differences in incomes of the farmers and non-farmers can not be eliminated overnight and automatically. These differences should be abolished gradually by social and economic development of the country. M. Pohorille^5 claims that the income disparity issue will not be resolved either by the introduction of a legislative act or by an economic manoeuvre.
^5 Pohorille, M. Ceny i dochody w rolnictwie. PWRiL, Warszawa 1972.
This implies that economic growth is only one of the many factors required to overcome the income disparity between agriculture and other sectors of the economy. Economic growth alone is not sufficient to achieve this goal. Adjusting agriculture to the new economic conditions created by economic growth also may be insufficient to resolve the issue of income disparities.
It is desirable that the governments should not try to resolve the issue of the income disparity between farmers and non-farmers solely by political decisions, even though the latter may be successful. Many governments have tried this, but in most cases unsuccessfully. The failure was generally attributed to the budgetary problems, and to the unwillingness of the consumers, who are also taxpayers, to cover the additional costs of supporting the farm population.
Structural changes in agriculture and their impact on incomes
The problems of farm household incomes cannot be disassociated from the issue of agricultural structural changes. The latter are to a great extent determined by the incomes policy adopted by the authorities. Both land consolidation and capital investment increase farm mechanisation and bring an increase in productivity. Increased productivity should be the main source of income increases in agriculture.
In most countries the agricultural policies aim to encourage structural changes in this economic sector. The desired changes may be defined in a number of various ways. In Poland, for example, structural changes underwent several different phases: in the 1940s, it was land reform; in the 1950s, collectivisation of agriculture; in the 1960s, the changes called for the socialist remodelling of villages; and in the 1970s, technical reconstruction. In the 1980s, there was no precise and commonly denominated policy, which is nowadays described as the system of transformation.
Irrespective of its name, the policy of structural changes in agriculture of industrialised countries, including Poland, aim at:
∑ Reduction of agricultural employment.
∑ Farm consolidation and enlargement.
From the income policy standpoint, both aims should lead to an income increase for farm households. The reduction in agricultural employment implies higher productivity, even when the structure of farms remains unchanged. Consolidation and enlargement of land area and of other means of production should also result in a higher productivity. Communist theoreticians assumed that increase in the scale of production would bring higher profits, but they did not take into account that at a certain point the additional land and machinery may cause diseconomies of scale, and thus increase the costs of production. This factor was ignored when big farm enterprises were formed in the former communist countries. Both processes, the reduction of the farm employment and land consolidation should be implemented only when justified by the economic factors and not by ideological or political factors.
In Poland, as well as in other communist countries, structural changes were driven primarily by ideological and not by the economic forces. A simple positive correlation was assumed between productivity and land consolidation, irrespective of the ownership and management of the land in question. In other words, land consolidation in Council for Mutual Economic Aid countries (CMEA), could only take either the form of co-operative farms or state-owned enterprises. Since the latter were regarded as more suitable for accomplishing the process of collectivisation, the official ideology preferred the state farm ownership to co-operative ownership. Economic factors were of minor importance for collectivisation in agriculture. The priority of ideology over economics resulted in very high subsidies channelled to the state and the co-operative sectors, which, nevertheless, recorded constant losses.
In Poland the majority of the cultivated land remained privately owned. However, the government followed a policy of freezing the structure of private farms. Changes in the number of farms and increases in farm size were minimal and did not change the agricultural land structure. The average size of farm remained constant and in 1995 this was approximately eight hectares (ha). In developed countries the changes in structural policies have aimed at consolidation of land and capital. The restructuring, however, is supposed to strengthen, and not to weaken, the private sector in those countries. Land consolidation has become one of the major goals of the advanced industrial countries, especially in the European Union. This is exemplified by changes in average size of farms in EU between 1960 and 1985.

At present, in all EU countries, with the exception of Greece, the average size of farms is bigger than in Poland. The same applies to the rate of increase in the average size of farms. In Poland it does not exceed one percent. In Western Europe, only Italy and Ireland recorded similar low rates of increase. In Finland, a new UE member, in 1994 the average farm size was 13.2 ha (including forest).^6 In the period between 1980-1994 the annual rate of average farm size growth did not exceed 1.5 percent. In Denmark the rate of growth was much higher than in Finland. In the period 1982-1990 it reached 2.8 percent annually.^7 In 1990, the average Danish farm was about 35.9 ha. On the whole, however, changes of land structure in agriculture are very slow, much slower than in other sectors of the economy.

Concentration of land and capital in advanced industrial countries would not be possible without reductions in employment in agriculture. And the latter are determined first of all by the growth of the whole economy. Economists usually agree that reduction of employment in agriculture has a positive impact both on agriculture and on the whole economy since the productivity level is usually lower for agriculture than for other sectors of the economy. Therefore, the transfer of the workforce into other sectors stimulates overall growth in national income. Furthermore, smaller employment in agriculture enables a more flexible price policy.
Agricultural employment and incomes
The following conclusions emerge from the analysis of the data on changes in agricultural employment in developed countries shown in Table 2A in the Appendix at the end of this chapter.
Over a long period of time very rapid decreases in agricultural employment (over four percent per year) was achieved in countries where the level of economic development is higher than in Poland. This confirms the claim that structural changes are affected by the development of the whole economy.
Poland recorded the slowest reduction in agricultural employment of all European countries. Of all 28 countries, only China recorded employment increase in agriculture, and in comparison to Poland, the pace of employment decrease was slower only in South Korea, New Zealand and Argentina. However, in New Zealand and Argentina the productivity is much higher then in Poland. The fastest decline in agricultural employment was recorded in the six countries which formed EEC in 1957, (except The Netherlands), countries in which the governments took very strong interest in agriculture.
Data on agricultural employment changes in Hungary, GDR, and Czechoslovakia show the role of the state in restructuring agriculture, in terms of changes in employment. (The non-economic effects of the agricultural employment reduction in the countries where agriculture was collectivised are not taken into account here. These were namely the destruction of the whole social class of peasants and, consequently, the creation of land ownership problems.)
As stated previously, the reduction of employment in agriculture usually brings about an increase in the farmers' per capita incomes. The rate of increase of per capita incomes in agriculture depends on the pace of increase in total incomes and on the pace of the employment changes.
Why are those relations so important in agriculture?
The rate of income increase in agriculture, that is the rate of increases in national income generated by agriculture, is usually much slower than in other sectors of the economy. For example, over a long period of time national income generated in Polish agriculture increased a maximum of one percent per year, whereas net national product increased by 1.3 percent. The advanced industrial countries do not show rapid increases in agricultural income either. For example, in the USA, between 1940 and 1980 the national income generated in agriculture increased by only 1.1 percent per year, whereas the whole economy increased by 3.6 percent However, at the same time the USA recorded a decrease in agricultural employment and an increased employment in other sectors of the economy. The average decrease in agricultural employment was 2.6 percent per year, whereas employment in other economic sectors increased by about 1.8 percent. As a consequence, national per capita agricultural
income increased by 3.7 percent per year and in other sectors of the economy by 1.8 percent.
Even though in the USA the increase in productivity was higher in agriculture than in other sectors, it did not solve problems related to the living conditions and consumption of the farm population. This is due to the fact that a part of the productivity gains in agriculture are transferred to other economic sectors by the market. Moreover, a part of the productivity gain is needed for farm development. And the less productive a farm is, the more funds are needed for farm development. Unfortunately, the Polish agricultural sector is characterised by slow increases in productivity. The average total productivity factor for Polish agriculture is estimated at 0.2-0.9 percent per year; whereas in advanced industrial countries, it reaches over 1.5 percent (in The Netherlands, for example, the productivity factor amounts to 3.5 percent over a long period of time). Therefore, it is not surprising that the investment rate for Polish agriculture, both in the private and in the state
sectors, increased from approximately four to five percent in the late 1950s to 15 percent in the 1980s. In advanced industrial countries the period of very rapid investment increases in agriculture seems to be over. This is shown by figures in Table 3A in the Appendix at the end of this chapter.
In Poland the modernising of agriculture is in its initial stage. Thus, supposing Poland follows a similar model of development, the investment rate should increase further as it did in advanced industrial countries. This will be an additional factor requiring farm income increases, especially since it cannot be expected that the incomes will increase solely as a result of a higher productivity in agriculture.
Achieving income goals in agriculture
There are two ways to attempt to equal incomes in farm households to those in non-farm households:
∑ political decisions;
∑ economic growth.
Communist politicians believed that income parity could be rather easily achieved by political decisions. However, many economists believed that the only way to achieve this goal is economic growth. There is still no clear solution this difference of opinion on this issue. As Bellerby's research and our analysis have shown, increase in incomes due to economic growth is a long-term and complex process. Income derived from agricultural production is influenced both directly by bringing down the costs of production, and indirectly by creating new sources of income in other sectors of the economy. This method is much more difficult than simply making political decisions. Moreover, it is less conspicuous. The act of making certain political decisions intended to help farmers usually has special appeal for the party in power.
The use of politics in influencing farmers' incomes was wide-spread in communist countries. The level of economic development in those countries, measured, e.g., by national income per head of population, was much lower than in advanced industrial countries. For example in the early 1980s, the level of national income in European communist countries was about 45 percent of that in industrial countries. Nevertheless, incomes of farmers were nearer parity in communist countries, which is shown by figures in Table 4A in the Appendix at the end of this chapter.
At the same time in USA and West Germany the relation between incomes per head of population in farm households and non-farm households was 78 and 68 percent, respectively.
Prices as an instrument of income policy
As mentioned, in advanced industrial countries the faster productivity increases in agriculture than in other sectors of the economy did not solve the issue of incomes of farm households. The reason for that, among other things, was the continuing decline in the real prices of farm products in most countries, which put the farmers at a disadvantage.
Free markets, if applied to agriculture in developed countries are believed to have a negative impact on farmers' incomes. The reason is very low (even zero) price and income elasticity of demand for food products. As output increases free markets can produce a continuing decline in relative prices. Therefore, it is argued that it is necessary for the state to intervene and take measures such as:
∑ Protecting domestic markets from low priced imports (import restrictions, customs duties, tariffs, quality norms, etc.).
∑ Increasing domestic demand (food coupons, special food programmes for children and the elderly, purchase of surpluses of agricultural products, etc.).
∑ Subsidising exports.
∑ Government intervention to maintain the level of internal prices and incomes.
∑ Creating new jobs for farm population.
Research in most developed countries shows that in the long run the economic conditions, in terms of relative prices, are disadvantageous for agriculture. In only a few countries (Ireland, Finland, Italy, Japan, Hungary) have the relationship between prices of goods purchased and of goods sold by farmers been favourable to farmers. Most countries recorded declining terms of trade for farmers, sometimes very large declines.
In Poland the situation was completely different from that in the developed market economies. In spite of unfavourable changes between 1982 and 1989, prices of agricultural products increased rapidly over a long period. In the 1960s prices of products sold by Polish farmers increased by 15.8 percent while the prices of products and services purchased by farmers increased by about 12 percent. Even though the increase of prices was not very large, nevertheless, relative price changes were favourable for agriculture. Between 1970 and 1980, the prices of products sold by farmers increased by 120 percent while the prices of products and services purchased by farmers increased less than 82 percent. However, by the end of the period, namely in 1978 and 1979, the ratio of the index of prices of purchased products compared to the index of products sold was slightly unfavourable for farmers, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively.
Until 1990, increasing prices were the basic source of increased farm incomes in Poland. There is a very simple explanation for this phenomenon. In advanced industrial countries the basic aim of agricultural policy was to increase the efficiency of agriculture, not to increase output, or more precisely, to increase the efficiency of productive factors in agriculture (total factor productivity). In Poland, however, until 1990, the issue of increasing agricultural output took priority over the question of efficiency. Because structural transformations of private farms were blocked and priority was given to developing a capital-consuming nationalised sector, it was necessary to implement special price policies. Price policies, however, were not developed according to scientists' suggestions. Decisions concerning prices often had very little effect because they were taken ex ante, which means in response to some phenomenon that had already occurred (usually after significant
agricultural output decrease). Because of the slow decline in the farm work force, it was necessary to raise prices of agricultural products in order to maintain the rate of income increases for farm households equal to that of non-farm households.
In developed countries, fast decline in the farm workforce brought about increases in incomes per head of population even though the level of agricultural output was more or less the same, and real prices of agricultural products fell. In OECD countries between 1960 and 1985 average employment in agriculture decreased by 3.2 percent, whereas average prices of agricultural products fell by 1.1 percent in a year. It meant increase in farmers' incomes by 2.2 percent in a year. In Poland, however, assuming a decrease in agricultural employment of 0.7 percent and an increase in prices of agricultural products of 1.8 percent (between 1970/72 and 1984/86), we arrive at the increase in farmers' incomes of 2.5 percent. It is thus only slightly higher than in OECD countries. The significant difference, however, lies in the way the increase was brought about. In OECD countries the whole rise was accounted for by decrease in agricultural employment; in Poland, only 28 percent was. The
increases of incomes of farm households in OECD countries was achieved by improving productivity, whereas in Poland the same goal was achieved by increasing prices. Other communist countries followed the pattern of Poland.
Between 1981 and 1984, relative incomes of the farm population in Poland were near parity, that is, the incomes of farmers and non-farmers were almost equal. However, over the period 1982-1989, the influence of price rises on increases in incomes was reduced, both in Poland and other communist countries. The relation between prices received and those paid by farmers worsened in Poland between 1982 and 1989 (with the exception of 1987).
The situation became very serious in 1990, resulting in social tensions within the population of private farmers. In the period of 1989-1994, agricultural prices were as shown in Table 3.

The price ratios worsened at the time when farmers who also were employed in other sectors of the economy were laid off from work. At that time approximately one-third of all farmers in Poland were part-time farmers and part-time workers. Until now, incomes derived from work other than agricultural production have represented a substantial proportion (about 40 percent) of total incomes in farm households.
Growth in agricultural production in Poland was capital consuming; it was connected with increased demand for means of production and hence for incomes. It is therefore not surprising that an economic crisis in the beginning of the 1990s had a greater negative influence on farm households, and especially on part-time farmers, than on non-farm households.
From the above analysis we could draw the conclusion that in countries characterised by high agricultural productivity income problems of farm households have been solved. That is, however, not the case. As we have demonstrated already, over a long period of time the level of incomes in farm households in those countries approximates the level of incomes in other sectors of the economy. The living standards of the two groups are becoming equal. One of the factors that contributes to this phenomenon is the still increasing proportion of income derived from work other than agricultural production. In many farm households this proportion is quite substantial, and amounts to 40 percent in Great Britain (1989), 42 percent in France (1981), 68 percent in Sweden (1980), 75 percent in Japan (1979).
Beliefs and values surrounding income protection for farmers in Poland during period of transition
In Poland, as in every country, agricultural policy has its advocates and opponents. These groups represent a different approach to solving major agricultural problems. The first group strongly advocates state intervention on behalf of agriculture. The other group, called liberals, is not only against state intervention in agriculture, but against any intervention of the state in the national economy.
The first group is represented mostly by people working very closely with agribusiness; e.g., farmers, peasant parties members, and many agribusiness professionals. They usually represent a so-called microeconomic approach, with agriculture as corn. As ideology, they use the eighteenth century slogan "They feed and defend." This means that farmers have special rights and should be given special attention. The second group, called liberals, macroeconomists, are advocates of free market and many of them claim that the laissez faire rules should be applied to the national economy without any sectoral exemptions. The discussion on the development of Polish agriculture, its restructuring and the role of the state became very intensive during the period of the transition of the national economy from centrally planned to the market-oriented economy.
In Poland, agriculture can not be ignored by any political party. Its position is still very strong, especially in terms of population and political power. Poland has a population of over 38 million, of whom 38.1 percent (14.7 million of which 1.07 million registered unemployed) live in rural areas. In 1994, only 1.8 percent of the rural population had a university education, 44.5 percent, an elementary education and 28 percent, a vocational education. In 1995, agriculture's contribution to the GDP was under seven percent. When Poland started its economic reform in 1990, agriculture seemed to be the only sector which would not require too many adjustments. At that time, more then two-thirds of arable land was owned and cultivated by private farmers. Thus only 25 percent of agricultural land required privatisation and restructuring. The main weaknesses of the private agricultural sector were too many small holdings (more than 2 million), a very high share of agricultural
employment to total employment (exceeding 26 percent), and very low efficiency, especially productivity of labour.
However, the major problem was the level of subsidy, both to agricultural production and to food purchases. The subsidy had almost become an economic monster in the food economy in Poland. Under communism Polish agriculture was a fully protected and regulated sector with guaranteed prices for producers, suppliers, consumers, low interest on credit, etc. Poland, like other communist countries, was a country of shortages, including food shortages. In 1989, the state subsidies to the food sector consisted of 10.8 percent of GDP and 28.3 percent of the total state expenditures. The result of such state policy towards the agricultural sector and consumers was a relatively high level of food consumption and farmers' incomes. The latter almost reached a parity level.
These state agricultural policies were appreciated very much by farmers. At present, the farmers claim that the period of the 1970s was the most favourable for them, in contrast to the current period of transition.
However, this form of agricultural policy had a very negative impact on the structural changes of Polish agriculture; the average farm size, about eight hectares, stayed almost unchanged for more than 40 years. As mentioned earlier, in August 1989, price controls on food were lifted. Once price controls were lifted, the agricultural sector received little attention, and there was no clear agricultural policy. It was generally felt that agriculture would act as a stimulus to Other sectors of the national economy. In October 1989 and January 1990, government subsidies granted to the food sector and primary agriculture were withdrawn. In 1992, the state expenditure on the rural sector was about nine percent of the total state expenditures, however, only 2.5 percent for agriculture itself (ca $200 million).
All of the measures taken forced the agricultural sector to be market-oriented. However, the transition towards a market economy created a number of problems in the agricultural sector:
∑ Agricultural production fell as a result of problems such as high interest rates on credit, expensive investments, falling sales opportunities and privatised businesses going bankrupt.
∑ Terms of trade worsened for agricultural producers. Inputs such as pesticides and fertilisers became more expensive while revenues fell as a result of a reduction in subsidies. Hence, the actual income of the primary sector decreased more sharply than other sectors (40 and 20 percent, respectively).
∑ Marketing channels were, and still are, not well developed.
∑ The restructuring process and privatisation of state agricultural enterprises has led to uncertainties regarding ownership and a place to work.
∑ Domestic food consumption fell as subsidies were withdrawn and incomes fell.
All of these pressures resulted in a change of the government from the solidarity party to social-democrats in 1993. A majority of farmers voted against the solidarity government, against the market-oriented economy. A new coalition, consisting of social-democrat and peasant parties has introduced a new agricultural policy, more oriented toward state intervention. This can be confirmed by the data on the state expenditure on the rural sector (PLN million).
All these measures taken by government aim to reduce the cost of agricultural production and raise farmers' incomes. One should note that agricultural pensioners contribute less than 10 percent to the social fund, which provides pensions to them. More than 90 percent of the pensions for farmers are financed by the state. Since the transition, farmers have been aided through the development of various compensation schemes, starting at a very low level but in most cases still providing a positive direction for farmers.
In order to bring about a change in the difficult situation in agriculture, an agency, Agencja Rynku Rolnego (AMA), was set up to stabilise agricultural markets, as a method of supporting farmers' incomes. Minimum Guaranteed Prices legislation was introduced for wheat, rye, sugar, meat and milk. The new agency is responsible for implementing this act. An additional argument used by state intervention advocates are subsidies provided to the agricultural sector in the developed countries, especially the European Union. In fact, agricultural subsidy levels in Poland, expressed as producer subsidy equivalent (PSE) is about one-third of those in the EU (in 1993,16 and 48 percent, respectively).

According to OECD statistics, in 1995, the level of subsidies in agriculture was as shown in Table 5.
In 1996, the level of all subsidies to Polish agriculture per farmer, including social payments, will not exceed $1,100, and excluding social payments, is $260.

During the transition period, the relative incomes of Polish farmers were not so low as their labour productivity. In the transition period, the per capita incomes of the farmers, were as follows (Table 6).

The above data do not confirm farmers' dramatic complaints about their relative economic situation. Despite a significant growth of state expenditures on the rural and agricultural sectors, Polish farmers are still not satisfied with agricultural policy. One has to remember that farmers in Poland and elsewhere are usually unhappy with agricultural policy. However, the so-called liberal economists are not in favour of current policy either, as these policies stand in the way of a free market. For them, a structural policy to improve the agrarian structure will provide a solution for the problems in agriculture. Their arguments also refer to the recent achievements of the national economy. In this respect they are right. Compared to other Central and East European countries, Poland has made significant progress in the last six years towards the establishment of an open dynamic market economy. Only in the years 1990-1991, was there a decrease in the GDP growth, by 7.5 and 7.0
percent, respectively. In the period of transition, 1990-1996, the growth of GDP was as follows:
1996 (predicted)
Since the start of the transition, high inflation rates and unemployment have been the primary sources of problems. In the years 1990-1996 the inflation and unemployment rates were as follows (Table 7).

For the macroeconomists the main factors of the growth of the national economy are:
∑ Human capital.
∑ Export.
∑ Investment.
∑ Domestic consumption.
As already pointed out, the human capital in agriculture in Poland is not well developed. Investment ability of farms is also limited. According to recent statistical data, less than 10 percent of the individual farms are able to accumulate their own funds for investment. Foreign investors are not very interested in investing in agriculture. They invest, first of all, in the food processing industry, which is much more stabile and predictable than the agricultural sector. Internal consumption of food will depend on the growth of incomes of the population.
Since the income elasticity for food is still rather low the only possibility for the development of Polish agriculture is the development of the food processing industry and the expansion of agricultural exports.
Conclusions
Problems connected with the level of incomes derived from agricultural production are very complex. They are intensified by the fact that it is extremely difficult to predict the situation on agricultural markets. However, governments can influence incomes in farm households by:
∑ Facilitating increase in productivity of the agricultural sector.
∑ Supporting schemes designed to create sources of incomes for farmers in other sectors of the economy.
There are no other ways. It is not possible to influence incomes over a long period of time by administrative decisions, such as subsidies, guarantees, etc., because of the objections raised by consumers-taxpayers. Despite many administrative programmes designed to control the income situation in agriculture, the proportion of farmers' incomes derived from work in other sectors of the economy is still increasing. This phenomenon can be observed in the whole world. We may even say that agricultural production is becoming marginal for farmers' incomes. It seems to me that this tendency is the one that will prevail for the coming years for Polish farmers.
Improving the income of farmers and rural people: A commentary
by Michel Petit
In France, as in Poland and many other countries, many government interventions have been undertaken to improve the income of farmers and rural people. These interventions reveal beliefs and values, which in fact have been widely shared across countries over the last century. But, they have changed through time and, of course, the pattern of their evolution has varied from place to place depending on specific geographical and historical circumstances.
A key belief in France, and perhaps also in other continental Western European countries, has been that we have an income problem in agriculture because farmers are inherently disadvantaged by market mechanisms. That belief goes back to the nineteenth century. The feeling was then that the competition from the new lands in America and in Oceania was unfair: why should we accept the destruction of our agriculture from this? Whether or not that proposition was an excuse or a real belief can be debated. Indeed, the industrialists at one point wanted protectionism and required the alliance of the farmers. Still, the belief has a lingering impact today.
That belief was strengthened by market instability in the 1930s. This led to the creation of the wheat board - Office National Inter-professional du BlÈ (ONIB) in 1936. After the Second World War, surpluses began accumulating in the 1950s, stressing the national budget, and again prices were depressed. The income problem was then attributed to malfunctioning markets or unfair markets, whatever that may mean.
In this context, where concerns of fairness and equity play such a critical role, it may be somewhat paradoxical that although the income disparities within agriculture were obvious, no real attempts were made to correct those inequalities within the agriculture sector. It would indeed be paradoxical if one assumed that beliefs and values directly determine policies in a simple, rational fashion. A political economy approach provides a better explanation. First, small, poor farmers had little voice, anyway. But farmers formed an alliance among themselves. If all these desperate farmers had brought the internal disparities to attention, they would have created great internal problems and weakened the ability of the farmers' alliance to lobby. So even if these small farmers recognised that, in a sense, they were providing an army to the rich farmers to fight the common battle, in which the bigger ones benefited more, the small farmers felt very clearly that by fighting for
higher prices they were also fighting for their own benefit. In addition, since they directly provided many of the factors of production, particularly labour, purchased inputs were a small fraction of their total cost. An increase in product prices would lead to a higher proportionate increase in their income than if they purchased most of their inputs.
In any case, the battle for prices and price intervention was clearly carried into the creation of the Common Market, which was welcomed by the French farmers. The budget constraint in the 1950s in France was such that there was a limit on how far farm prices could be increased. The big attraction of the creation of the Common Market and the Common Agricultural Policy was that the budget constraint would be relieved. Since then, great attention has continued to be paid farm incomes, as revealed by the debates around the poor quality of farm income indicators.
In the 1950s and 1960s, the farm accountancy data were very poor and available only for a very biased sample of farms. The result is that the main indicators of farm income have come from national accounts. The main indicator used in the policy debate has been average value added per worker, which in fact is not a measure of income but of productivity. Sometimes average gross income per farmer is used. The problem with it is that all costs are not deducted from gross receipts. I do not need to go further into technicalities. Many countries have faced the same limitations. First of all, the indicator is an average, and this immediately raised the question of what constitutes a farm. With more and more part-time farmers, that issue becomes even more critical. Such indicators are sectoral, they relate to farm activities but do not include the family income from non-farm sources. In spite of these limitations, many policy debates were conducted in terms of parity indices which
we, like the Poles, tried to import from the USA where there is a very rich literature on the topic. I am not sure how enlightening these debates were. Nevertheless, they addressed problems which were and continue to be serious in France. But parity indices never really 'caught on.' The debates they generated were probably seen as too technocratic and as not really getting to the core of the issue. As a result, the main debate on average farm income issues has been around year-to-year variations in farm incomes, a close parallel to a point made by Leszek Klank in his paper.
The concerns for disparities within the agricultural sector, although secondary as discussed above, have not been totally eliminated. They have led large farmers and their organizations to demonstrate their solidarity with their less fortunate colleagues in concrete ways. Thus, for instance, cereal growers have funded UNIGRAIN, a fund investing in livestock production and, thus, an instrument to show support to and solidarity with livestock farmers. Recently, because of the budget costs of compensating beef farmers affected by the 'mad cow' affair, grain farmers contributed financially to a fund to help beef farmers. In addition, issues described as income disparities across regions, are also very prominent in the EU policy debate. They directly impinge on the attitudes vis-a-vis the environment and regional development measures, issues which have become critical in the emergence of a new social contract between farmers and society at large.
Group discussion on "improving the income of farmers and rural people"
Some of the discussion centred on the expectations held by persons in Central Europe regarding whether joining the EU and adopting the CAP would solve the income problem for farmers in Central Europe. There was widespread agreement among participants from Western Europe that the Central European countries would make a huge mistake if they tried to adopt the CAP. They pointed out that the policy has created all sorts of problems in Western Europe and that it is not sustainable. Farm organization leaders know this, but they are fighting to keep as much of the income transfers as possible.
There was a general agreement that the problem of the lack of a safety net for the elderly, poor, and others at the low end of the income scale in Central Europe was creating significant political problems. Moreover, it was argued that the heritage of the past leads people to save little and invest little because they are doubtful about the certainty of future events. There is no tradition of passing property to children so there is little incentive to save. However, this lack of saving means that older people depend on the government to provide a safety net in their retirement years.
Persons from the Central European countries agreed that the major push for joining the EU was not the expectation of higher incomes. The push comes from political desires to have the safety of belonging to Western Europe in a political sense, although most projections show that income growth will be faster if Central European countries join the EU.

CHAPTER 6 INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
International trade in food and agricultural products
International trade in agricultural products: A commentary on polish international trade in agro-food products
Group discussion on "international trade in agricultural products"
International trade in food and agricultural products
by Aart de Zeeuw
A discussion of trade policy should start with the understanding that for most countries, and certainly for Western Europe, agricultural trade policy is an extension of domestic agricultural policy. We have discussed the economic and social values that Western Europe has placed on the maintenance of a family farm system and viable rural areas. This explains why certain agricultural policies have been developed in the past with the aim of protecting farm incomes.
In general one can say that low cost producing countries (favourable agricultural conditions and/or big farms often with a high level of technology), in particular when they depend on export, defend an open market policy, because they can compete easily on the world market with countries with a high cost agricultural structure (less favoured areas and/or many small farms often with a low level of modem technology). Western Europe has viewed most of its farmers as being unable to compete and has maintained a trade policy that has helped maintain its domestic policies designed to protect its farmers.
A different approach for agricultural and industrial sectors
In most countries of the EU the prevailing belief has been that the farm population could not survive without protection from low cost imports; substantial pauperisation of rural areas could take place with all the negative consequences, both socially as well as with regard to nature and environment. Countries with higher cost agriculture have been unwilling to open their agricultural sectors to liberal trade without support. The easiest way to protect the agricultural sector was through border measures such as high, variable levies or tariffs that maintained internal prices at some politically determined level above world prices. If domestic production exceeded domestic demand export subsidies are used to bridge the gap between the world market price and the higher internal price. For some products in some countries there was a total ban on imports.
Another way of protecting farm income was to use deficiency payments if the internal price dropped below the price guaranteed by the government. This results in large government expenditures when world prices are low.
Both methods distorted competition and trade and the consumer paid the price; either as taxpayer or as a consumer paying high prices.
In the past, most countries in the developed world followed a policy of guaranteeing prices to farmers. Protection using border measures was, and still is, quite common. It is believed in countries like Switzerland, Norway and in quite a few member states of the EU, like Finland, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, the southern part of France and Germany, part of Great Britain (in the north in particular), agriculture cannot survive without high protection. This is also the case in quite a few countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Other European countries, or parts of countries, like Ireland, Denmark, The Netherlands, the Flemish part of Belgium, the northern part of France and Germany and part of Great Britain, can compete. With the start of the EC and during its lifetime, agricultural policy has always been discussed on the basis of the EC's not being able to compete on world markets. High guaranteed prices were deemed necessary for farmers in less favoured areas and were
welcomed by farmers in better areas. During the 1980s it became very clear that a rapid growth of production per hectare and animal, partly due to the high price support and partly explained by productivity increases, led to such overproduction, that market distortions (low prices) created trade wars and very high governmental expenditure for price supplements and surplus removal.
The developed world, during the Uruguay Round of negotiations, finally accepted the need to change its agricultural policies in such a way that more open trade would become possible in the future. Direct income support will gradually replace price support. This makes it possible to lower tariffs substantially (other measures of border protection like quantitative restrictions are now forbidden), to replace price supports with income payments and to get rid of export subsidies. The new farm bill in the US is an example of this development; as is, clearly, the change of agricultural policy in the EU for certain products (cereals and oilseeds).
The fanning communities are not happy with this change in agricultural policies. The agricultural sector is confronted directly with changing world market prices and becomes more dependant on the willingness, or even the financial ability of government to support farm incomes directly. On the other hand, the new policy orientation will certainly stimulate a more efficient market-oriented agriculture, more focused on consumer wishes, less dependant on governmental support and more capable to compete in the markets with other suppliers.
To focus our discussion, it seems useful to address some questions on the beliefs and values underlying EU trade policy in agriculture:
∑ Is international trade in food and agricultural products viewed as a way to dispose of excess production and supplement production deficits, or as a way to benefit from specialisation and comparative advantage to achieve more goods at lower resource costs?
∑ Is it believed that trade works to the disadvantage of domestic producers and should be limited to insure domestic producers protection against foreign competition? Is international competition viewed as fair, and if not, why not?
∑ Are imported food and agricultural products viewed as improving consumer choice and well-being, or are they viewed as a threat to food quality and safety?
∑ Are imported food and agricultural products viewed as threats to domestic food security, and if so, why?
Coming back to the questions, mentioned in the beginning of this paper it is worthwhile to remind ourselves that the background of every agricultural policy lies in the fact that production conditions differ from region to region and that in every country most of the land needs to be cultivated.
First question:
Is International trade in food and agricultural products viewed as a way to dispose of excess production and supplement production deficits, or as a way to benefit from specialisation and comparative advantage to achieve more goods at lower resource costs?
In the past foreign markets and international trade were viewed as the least expensive way of disposing of surpluses that could not be used domestically at the internal market price. The reason that this happened lies in an agricultural policy based on keeping internal market prices at a high level. This led to surplus production that could not be used internally without depressing internal prices and could not be exported without subsidies. One may expect that as a result of a change of agricultural support from price support to direct income support, these trade distorting measures will disappear.
The second part of the question concerns the economic benefit of specialisation and comparative advantage in a complete open market without trade distorting support. One cannot deny the logic of this statement and the values that underlie it, but there are other values that say that agriculture must continue to exist in many disfavoured areas (by climate, topography, fertility) for social and environmental reasons (see other papers). The answer to this value conflict lies in an open market policy which forces the agricultural sector to become as competitive as possible, given the physical conditions; and at the same time allows governments to give permanent income support as a compensation for the economic disadvantages in disfavoured areas; as a payment for keeping the environment in good condition or as a temporary support when restructuring of the agricultural sector in certain regions is necessary. This is the direction in which the EU policy is moving.
Second question:
Is it believed that trade works to the disadvantage of domestic producers and should be limited to insure domestic producers protection against foreign competition?
Many farmers in the EU still hold the value that it is their right to produce for the domestic market and that imports should only be permitted if the domestic producers do not produce certain products or when there is a shortage. Many agricultural producers believe that having to compete with producers that have more favourable structures or cost levels is unfair, and they oppose the removal of all border protection.
Third question:
Are imported food and agricultural products viewed as improving consumer choice and well being, or are they viewed as a threat to food quality and safety?
It is the duty of every government, including the EU, to guard the health of the consumers from the importation of unsafe products, and governments are responsible for trade policies to allow for the availability of enough food and a diverse food supply, so that the consumer can be sure of buying the food he wants. Imported food and agricultural products will, in general, improve consumer choice and are not a threat to safety if governments maintain internationally agreed upon health standards (Codex, e.g.). Concerning technical food quality, the consumer is normally able to control that himself.
However, this does not always cover all the related aspects. In particular, the question of quality and safety in relation to the production method are becoming increasingly important values for EU consumers. Internationally agreed upon food standards concern the quality of the products and not production methods used to produce the products. Consumers, in particular in developed countries, demand more and more food products, which are produced in a natural and/or environmentally friendly way (e.g. without the use of chemicals or hormones). In some cases they put pressure on their own governments to limit the use of chemicals (quantity as well as quality), although one cannot prove that the use is dangerous for human health.
In general, one can solve this problem through labelling. The consumer can make his own choice, whether he accepts the normal international standards or special ones. However, it becomes difficult when in response to consumer values on food standards governments develop legislation on food standards which go beyond those that are internationally agreed upon and refuse to allow imports of products which do not meet the higher standards in spite of the fact that they meet the internationally agreed upon standards. A good example is the refusal of the EU to import meat that comes from beef which are treated with natural hormones during their lifetime, in spite of the international agreement mat the use of these hormones is no threat to health. The EU uses the argument that the consumer does not want meat from animals that are treated with hormones. From a legal point of view, this is not a very strong argument, and it is better not to refuse imports and to solve this problem
through labelling.
Fourth question:
Are imported food and agricultural products viewed as threats to domestic food security, and if so, why?
The answer to this question depends on the definition of domestic food security. If one defines food security as the possibility to produce domestically enough food to be able to cover the minimum food requirements of the population in times when the import of food is almost impossible, it is an argument to protect domestic production facilities necessary to produce that minimum amount, even when this is only possible with high costs. The consumers in some countries have placed a high value on food security, and producers have used it to support their demands for high levels of protection. For a period after World War II this was a major value held by people in Western Europe, but it seems to have declined in importance in recent years as memories of war-time hunger disappeared into the past.
One can also define food security as the possibility to have enough food available by having access to necessary imports and/or carrying stocks to bridge unexpected periods of shortages. With this definition, it is not necessary to support and maintain costly domestic production.
The choice between the two policies regarding food security depends very much on two aspects. The first one concerns the question of whether we really believe that any country can survive a possible major modem war by producing enough food to meet consumption needs year by year. It would appear better to maintain the capacity to expand production in case of international emergency.
The second one concerns the question of whether food security requires an international trade rule ensuring that it is no longer possible to block food exports. If so, there is no argument to secure the food situation through high cost production of food in normal times, and trade liberalisation does not threaten food security.
During the next five years, the discussion on future agricultural policy in the EU will take place on the basis of papers, prepared by the Commission. The very important Agricultural Strategy Paper (ASP) of December 1995 on the future development of the CAP, also in relation to the expected enlargement of the EU to include the CEE countries, will be followed by papers on different subjects. One may expect that in these papers the favoured option of the Commission in the ASP, in which it is proposed to extend the changed grain policy (lower prices, compensated by income support) to other products, will be the basis for changing the existing policies on different agricultural products.
There are two good reasons for this expectation.
∑ These policy changes will be consistent with a further liberalisation of world trade of agricultural products.
∑ They also fit into the expected further integration of agricultural policy with rural policy, including social and environmental issues.
Income support instead of price support is a better tool with which to realise this integration, because one can more easily focus the support on the difference in needs of the agricultural sector in various regions (e.g., necessary support in disfavoured regions differs in kind and amount from the more favoured areas).
Expected changes in EU agricultural and rural policies will certainly influence the development of agricultural and rural policies in the CEE countries for the simple reason that as soon as they join the EU, they must be prepared to accept the EU regulations. Seen in that light, it seems worthwhile for the CEE countries, before shaping their own policies, to look very carefully at what happens in the EU.
In summary, beliefs and values regarding the need to maintain and protect farms and rural areas from conditions that would destroy them have led to a number of domestic agricultural policies in the EU. The form of those domestic policies was to maintain high domestic farm prices supported by restrictive trade policies that limited competition from lower cost imports. These restrictive trade policies were supported by values that called for food security through domestic production and for the elimination of unfair competition, which was defined as competition from producers with lower costs.
Now EU domestic policy is putting less emphasis on maintaining high internal prices to assist small farms and disadvantaged areas. Changing beliefs and values shift programmes toward income supports based on environmental protection and rural development. This allows the EU to move toward a more liberal trade policy with less emphasis on high levels of border protection.
International trade in agricultural products: A commentary on polish international trade in agro-food products
by Leszek Klank
The paper on trade policy in the EU raises the most important issues related to international trade in agro-food products. Let me concentrate only on selected issues, which are very strictly connected to the topic of the seminar. I would like to concentrate on competitiveness of Polish international agro-food trade and on changes of values in this area.
For many years exports have had a significant influence on economic development of the Polish economy. This includes agro-food trade too. International trade, and particularly exports, is believed to be one of the main factors of the development of the Polish economy. It is even called an engine (locomotive) of development. Polish trade policy has as its chief aim expansion of exports.
The reason for such a policy is as follows. Growth in agricultural exports would cause the incomes of farmers to rise, which in turn would improve agricultural productivity and production.
In the last six years of the transformation of the Polish economy there have been rapid changes in international trade. In 1995, the value of exports increased by almost 33 percent and imports by 35 percent over 1994. In 1994, exports rose by 22 and imports by 15 percent, compared to the previous year. In the years 1992-1996 the value of international trade was as follows (Table 1).
TABLE 1. Value of Polish international trade - 1992-1996 (billion US$)
Export
Import
Balance

According to recent information provided by the government, the trade balance at the end of 1996 reached minus 12 billion US dollars. This is the largest trade deficit in recent Polish history. Polish exports slowed down in the years 1992 and 1993, mainly due to economic recession in Western Europe. At the same time imports increased as a result of Poland's growing integration into the world economy and growing domestic consumption. Exports strongly recovered in the period 1994-1996 in line with European recovery. These tendencies prove that Poland's economy is not closed anymore.
Since 1993, there has been a systematic increase in the trade of agro-food products. In 1995, Polish agro-food exports increased by 20 percent to US$ 2.5 billion while imports amounted to almost US$ 3 billion and increased by 23 percent over the previous year. The trade deficit in agro-food products increased in 1995 by about 45 percent (US$ 476 million from US$ 327 million in 1994). The share of agro-food exports in total exports decreased from 11.9 percent in 1993 and 12.1 percent in 1994 to 11.0 percent in 1995. The same tendency occurred in the imports; the share of agro-food imports dropped from 11.9 percent in 1993 to 10.3 percent in 1995. Comparing official data on international trade, one has to take into consideration very important non-registered, cross-border trade, especially between Poland, Germany, Russia and the Czech Republic. According to estimates made by the Central Statistical Office in 1995, the value of total cross-border trade amounted to US$ 5.8
billion; for 1996, this trade is predicted to reach US$ 7.2 billion. We can assume that 10 percent of the cross-border trade is attributed to agro-food trade. Despite rapid growth in trade, the integration of Poland with the world market is still relatively low. The share of Polish exports in world exports is about 0.5 percent, whereas Poland accounts for 0.7 percent of the world population. The value of exports per capita is still very low compared to other European countries.
The European Union is still the major trade partner of Poland. The share of the European Union both in exports and imports remains about 55 percent.
There has been a declining trend in the trade between Poland and the European Union in recent years. However, there is a completely different trend in trade with Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries. This trend also shows the changes in values. After the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1989, there was a drastic reduction in the trade with the FSU. The share of Polish trade with FSU was reduced to less than 10 percent. One has to remember than until 1989 the Soviet Union was Poland's major trade partner. In early 1950s, the Soviet Union was the almost exclusive trade partner for Poland. Polish society was against any trade with the Soviet Union. The society believed that trade with the Soviet Union was unfair, unjust. There is some evidence that society was right to some extent (e.g., low prices for Polish coal paid by Russians during so-called Stalinism period). These unfair low prices for Polish exports were somehow regulated by N. Khrushchiev, and in 1989, Poles still
remembered the times of exploitation.

It is interesting that the Soviet society believed that the Soviet Union supported all communist countries, including Poland via trade agreements. The Russian people believed that that they had to pay a contribution to keep the communist system running in other countries. All of this created special values, and led to unpleasant relationships between Poles and Russians. Poles believed that trade with the Soviet Union led to worsening their standard of living. Similar beliefs were held on the Russian side. The quality of exported goods within Comecon countries was extremely low.
The best quality products were from Yugoslavia and East Germany. After liberalisation in 1989, trade with the Soviet Union decreased dramatically. The solidarity government went along with society's values and beliefs. At that time there was an official policy of the state to minimise trade relations with the Soviet Union. This policy has changed since 1994. The figures below illustrate the relations with the Soviet Union and Former Soviet Union countries in agro-food trade (Table 3).
TABLE 3. Polish trade with the Soviet Union/Russia and FSU countries (million US$)
Year

In the years 1994 and 1995, the share of the FSU countries in total agro-food exports was 28 and 31 percent, respectively. Now, nobody in Poland talks about unfair trade with Russians. Poles want profitable export business irrespective of the nation buying the goods. In their business they do not pay attention to history and bad experiences. Money is the key value for them.
Another important issue is the competitiveness of the Polish agro-food sector. Competitiveness is a very complex and dynamic issue. The rapid transformation of the Polish economy and changes in the world's economy are, for example, resulting both in a gradual rise of domestic input prices and changes in price relations. Some factors often noted for Poland's competitiveness in agro-food products are still low costs of labour and land. They have a significant influence on costs of farm products, as raw materials for the food processing industry.
As already mentioned, competitiveness is a dynamic process influenced by many factors. The most important are:
∑ Appreciation of domestic currency.
∑ Economic growth causing increase of input prices, especially labour.
∑ Production efficiency improvement resulting from the economy restructuring and adoption of new technologies.
∑ Improvement of distribution efficiency that leads to lower transaction costs, trade margins, etc.
∑ State policy towards international trade, e.g., protection of the domestic markets, promotion of agro-food exports on the foreign markets, etc.
A majority of Poles believe that Polish agro-food trade is competitive on the international markets, not only because of low costs of manufacturing, but also because of special taste, good quality, specific methods of production (e.g., pigs fed with potatoes). Also international trade has a positive influence on the competitiveness of Polish agriculture. It has forced our producers to compete both in domestic and foreign markets. This leads to the improvement of the quality of products, better preparation of products for sale (packaging), and enlargement of the products offered for trade (variety).
Increased imports have had a significant impact on consumers, who now have better access to new products, a larger variety and higher quality products. The Polish currency (zloty) exchange rate to foreign currency, especially the dollar, is particularly important for the competitiveness of Polish international trade, and agro-food trade as well. One has to remember that about 45 percent of transactions in Polish international trade are made in US dollars. Thus, appreciation of Polish zloty against the US dollar leads to a decrease of Polish exports. Such a situation existed in 1995.
Although the main goal of Polish policy is political and economical integration with the European Union, our trade relations in the near future are in CEFTA, the Former Soviet Union countries and probably the Far East (China). The quality of Polish products is still not very high, making it extremely difficult to compete within European Union countries. This applies mostly to industrial products (e.g., textiles), not to agricultural products.
Group discussion on "international trade in agricultural products"
The discussion focused on the trade policies and trade activities in Central Europe under the old central planning system and the impact it has had on current policies and trade patterns. There was general agreement that under the old system the purpose of trade was to fulfil the plans. Producers of the various traded products had no decisions as to what was produced and traded, and often they did not know who the final consumers were of the products they produced. Under the old system there was no value placed on product quality and quantities needed to fulfil consumption plans were most valued.
Since most of the agricultural exports under the planned system were to the Soviet Union there was a general belief that the exports were at the expense of domestic consumers, and there was a belief that the terms of trade with the Soviet Union were unfair. Trade policy under the old system was basically protectionist. Imports were for the purpose of filling consumption targets, and internal competition was not allowed. Thus, neither import nor export trade served the purpose of improving domestic efficiency or of improving the use of resources by taking advantage of the comparative advantage of the country.
The movement to a sophisticated market-driven trade system is proving difficult. Among the difficulties is the fact that government officials in the Central European countries do not understand the new system and how to negotiate effectively within it. Two cases were cited to illustrate this point. The first is the experience of the Hungarians, who are being threatened with action in the World Trade Organization for failing to comply with the limits on export subsides that they agreed to in their country schedule filed as part of their Uruguay Round commitments. There was some discussion that the Hungarian commitments were made without understanding their implications and that it is unfair for countries such as the United States to insist they honour the commitments. However, it was agreed mat if the Hungarians were allowed to ignore their commitments to limit export subsidies, other countries would do the same, including the EU.
The second issue was the belief that the EU had taken unfair advantage in negotiating the association agreement with Central European countries by negotiating import quota systems whereby the EU importers control all of the imports and obtain all of the quota rents.
Despite the misgivings about the fairness of trade with the Soviet Union under the old system, trade with the FSU is growing rapidly in recent years. One reason is that the products from Eastern Europe often are not competitive in EU markets in terms of processing or packaging, but they are competitive in the FSU as their consumers move to higher quality products. There apparently is a widespread feeling among producers and processors in Central Europe that they do have a comparative advantage in food and agricultural products, and they expect to become fully competitive in the EU when the trade barriers into the EU are dropped.
There was a discussion about the status of trade policy in Central Europe. It was suggested it has gone through three stages. The first stage was liberalism, with open borders and little protection. The second stage has been reality that came when they recognised that the trade policies and practices of other countries could create serious internal problems and pressures for domestic producers. They became especially conscious of the impact of dumping and export subsidies into their markets, and the barriers and tactics used by others to impede their exports.
This has led to the third stage of trade policy, which is pragmatism. The Central European countries are now moving to policies that are responses to the trade policies of other countries, such as dumping or export subsidies, but they have not yet developed coherent trade policies that are consistent with and related to their domestic agricultural policies. This may be in large part due to the fact that the Central European countries have not developed comprehensive agricultural policies.
Finally, there was a discussion of the fact that the EU is moving away from a trade policy that is entirely an extension of domestic agricultural policy. The decoupling of domestic subsides allows this change. In addition, new values are becoming import in EU trade policy. These include values relating to production processes, and the desire of animal rights groups and others to bar imports produced in certain ways or from certain countries. As yet, these values have not become major policy determinants in Central Europe.

CHAPTER 7 ENVIRONMENT ISSUES IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL AREAS
Protecting the rural environment - The UK experience
Protecting the rural environment: A commentary
Group discussion on "The rural environment"
Protecting the rural environment - The UK experience
by Frances Sandiford-Rossmiller
Values and beliefs about agriculture and the rural environment in the UK have to be understood in the specific historical and geographical context of the country. The discussion that follows really concerns England: Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are rather different by reason of their economy, history, geography or systems of law or governance. They often have their own statutory bodies. Although the EU's agricultural, rural and environmental policies apply throughout the UK, the underlying attitudes and pressures that have been brought to bear on policy formation stem largely from the English experience. Nevertheless, most of the discussion that follows refers to both England and Wales by virtue of the long political and economic integration of Wales into the UK and its proximity to the main centres of English urban population. However, unless stated otherwise, statistics are for the UK as a whole.
A brief history of the 'countryside' movement
Rural Britain in the sense of countryside -landscape and scenery - is almost entirely the product of agricultural processes that have been going on since prehistoric times. More than 80 percent of the land is under some form of agricultural management: the area of woodland at just under 10 percent is low by western European standards (averaging almost one-quarter), and little of that is ancient woodland. For a variety of historical reasons, including the parliamentary enclosure acts of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,^1 which were related to but not the sole reason for the development of capitalist agriculture, and the early birth of the industrial revolution, the proportion of the population engaged in agriculture has been the lowest in Europe for well over a hundred years: only 8-12 percent (sources vary greatly in their estimates) at the turn of the century compared with 40 percent for France and over 40 percent for Germany. The industrial revolution had itself
had an important impact on agriculture with the successful pressure for cheap food for urban consumers that led to the final repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 and an increasing dependence on imported food supplies. The agricultural depression of the late nineteenth century that these policies led to gave increased impetus to the further commercialisation of agriculture and shedding of labour. The owner-occupier family farm was not the development model that it was in Denmark, for example, and until after World War II when death duties and other taxation, and agricultural depression had made the owner-farmer the predominant organizational mode, large landowners and tenant farmers were common.
^1See J.M. Neeson. Commoners: Common Right, Enclosures and Social Change in England, 1700- 1820 Cambridge University Press, 1993. And W.G. Hoskins. The Making of the English Landscape Penguin, 1985.
Thus by the beginning of this century, the vast majority of the population was divorced by more than one generation from direct experience of agricultural production. The importance of agriculture in the rural economy, although variable, was declining rapidly. In the northern and midland heartland of the industrial revolution, former villages became industrial cities and towns. The building of railways and tramways led to uncontrolled suburban sprawl as the urban middle classes and the industrialists sought to escape the grim conditions of the cities. So began the suburbanisation of the rural areas, the urbanisation for non-industrial reasons of small towns and villages, and the search for the 'lost' and very largely mythical rural values and quality of life.
The prevailing English ethos of 'rurality' has been described by Hoggart et al^2 as "essentially defined and maintained by an urban-centred population (and arguably for that population as well)," and the associated rural tradition is naturalist, "which derives more overtly from a conception of rural space as an arena for consumption." This is clearly reflected in the formation of voluntary conservation organizations whose main interests have been to protect wildlife and landscape and to gain access to the countryside. The parliamentary enclosure acts, which largely completed the process of transforming the medieval open field fanning system with its commoners' rights to private ownership, wage labour and modem agricultural practices, led to the formation in 1865 of the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpath Preservation Society. Its objective was to "fight the enclosure of the remaining common lands for agriculture and to try to retain them for amenity."^3 The Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds (RSPB) was founded in 1889 as "the reaction of animal lovers to the slaughter of birds of prey and other 'vermin' on game estates, and the general persecution of birds and other animals by the plumage trade and collectors."^4 1895 saw the birth of the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty, which had both landscape and wildlife conservation objectives.^5 Other organizations followed in the twentieth century, including the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the Councils for the Preservation of Rural England, Scotland and Wales, the County Nature Conservation Trusts, the Ramblers Association, and a whole range of recreational associations. Landscape, scenic amenity and concern for wildlife habitats represented essentially middle-class urban interests.^6

^4 Green, op. cit.
^5 The National Trust is today the largest organization active in the conservation arena with well over one million members. It has become a very large landowner, seeing that as the best way of securing conservation with access and amenity. Death duties have assisted its acquisitions, as has the statutory power conferred in the first National Trust Act of 1907 to hold land inalienable.
^6 Green, op. cit., distinguishes between landscape and scenery as follows: landscape is a particular configuration of topography, land-use, vegetation cover and settlement pattern; scenery is the visual impression of a tract of country.
The working class interest in the countryside made itself felt in the areas surrounding the midland and northern cities of the industrial revolution where the demand was for access on the one holiday of the week to the green open spaces outside the cities - the Pennine moors of the Peak District in particular - for recreation in the form of rambling and climbing. "Surrounded by the sprawling industrial cities of northern England and the Midlands, it was the last unspoilt outpost of the southern Pennines, and a precious weekend escape for the teeming populations created in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. Half the population of England lived within 60 miles of the Peak."^7 Here there was direct conflict with the large landowners who managed their moors for shooting, combining low density grazing with careful management of the vegetation (especially heather) for game bird cover. A succession of attempts from 1908 to 1939 to reach agreement on access failed because of the
entrenched landowner interests in Parliament. With improvements in transport communications that facilitated travel to the area, the pressure built up. Clubs organized huge open-air rallies to campaign for access to the hills and moors, and in 1932 a Mass Trespass was held on Kinder Scout in the Derbyshire Peak District. But despite the strong public support and pressure for access, it was only in 1955, four years after the creation of the Peak District National Park, that the first access agreement to Kinder was signed.

Values and beliefs about agriculture and the rural environment
The naturalist tradition of rurality identified by Hoggart et al.^8 "is a composite notion founded on the representation of the countryside first and foremost in terms of landscape and nature. This vision is generally accompanied by the belief that ,a (rather ill-defined) traditional rural way of life is superior born to urban and to contemporary rural life. Taken together, these arcadian and pastoral myths constitute the basis for a rural nostalgia that in Britain at least has become '...the basis of the role that the countryside plays in national identity'.... in no other nation has countryside protection become such a political rallying point for (commonly) middle class home-owners, united not so much as co-members in ecological or environmental movements as by a shared concern for the depreciating value of a consumer good; to whit, rural amenity and more specifically the sanctity of rural residential amenity." The power of this myth in the wartime experience is noted
caustically by Calder:^9 "Georgian poets and their associated cricket correspondents had dwelt nostalgically on the beauties of the English countryside and the virtues of the English yokel, while the former had decayed and the latter, if they had had much enterprise, had fled to the towns. Even during the war, many writers who should have known better implied mat the soldiers and airmen were dying to preserve an essentially rural Britain, the fantasy world of the minor and more optimistic followers of Thomas Hardy, of Mrs Miniver and of P.O. Wodehouse."
^8 Hoggart et al, op. cit.
^9 A. Calder. The People's War: Britain 1939-1945. London: Pimlico, 1996.
That this vision has lost none of its carrying power is evidenced by the purple prose of the White Paper published in October 1995:^10
^10 Rural England: A Nation Committed to a Living Countryside. Department of the Environment, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Cm 3016. London: HMSO, October 1995.
The enduring character of England is most clearly to be found in the countryside. Yet the pace of change has quickened and much of what we value most about the rural scene seems threatened by increasing mobility, the pressures of leisure and recreation, the decline of jobs in rural industries and the demands for new jobs in businesses which would once have been found only in the towns.
So this White Paper is about a living and working countryside. It recognises the stresses and strains of widespread change but it never forgets those distinctive qualities whose preservation is a continuing commitment in a country which values the rural way of life.
Of course governments need to approach such an enterprise with humility. The future health of rural England does not rest primarily in their hands, for the countryside is the product of a myriad of human actions over many centuries, moulding the natural world until it is difficult to distinguish what man has created from what nature provided.
Most of what we most value in the natural scene is the product of farming - hillsides whose beauty is dependent upon grazing, water meadows which need to be used for cattle if they are to be preserved, dry stone walls, hedges and traditional building.
But where exactly does agriculture fit into this vision? What part does it play in the creation and maintenance of the myth? It has itself been ruthlessly romanticised, mythologised and exploited through the manipulation by advertising agencies of the rural fantasy, and the production of television programmes and films set in the pre-1950s. A population that is urbanised and knows little about farming practices is repeatedly fed with images of chickens pecking around in the farmyard; the ruddy-faced farmer's daughter hand-milking cows called Buttercup or Daisy; cosy farmhouse kitchens with the farmer's wife baking bread; jolly haymaking scenes where the children are given special holidays from school to help; stupendous farmed scenery apparently teeming with wildlife (and usually in glorious sunshine). The reality before the war was very different in the deep agricultural depression, and it is even more different now. The role of farmers as guardians of the national heritage
- that beautiful countryside -has been and still is being assiduously promoted by the agricultural lobby, the government and the romanticiser: "... farmers have an obvious interest in managing their land wisely and handing it down to then-children in good order. We rely on them to act as stewards of England's countryside, using best environmental practice to nurture its quality and wealth of wildlife."^11
^11 Ibid.
How much worse, therefore, has been the demonising of the farmer when the general public started to realise rather belatedly what the consequences of modem farming can be for the environment and the farm animals. Factory farming of livestock; wholesale ripping out of hedges; draining of wetlands; monoculture not only of cereals but also of grass as high levels of nitrogen fertiliser and herbicides destroy the mixed pastures; and the disappearance of many birds has induced a sense of deep betrayal in the public at large.
The reaction on the part of farmers to the conservation lobby has at times been very hostile. At the peak of the CAP-induced agricultural prosperity, it was not uncommon to hear farmers voice the sentiment when the question of access to the countryside was raised: this is my workplace; how would they like it if we just walked onto their factory floor and strolled round looking at the view. But farmers too have felt betrayed and bewildered by the hostility expressed towards them and their actions. They have been very policy-responsive: post-war grants to 'improve' agriculture by ploughing up moorland and heathland, applying lime and ripping out hedges were notably successful. Now they are pilloried for doing just that, and subsidised to reverse the 'damage.' Their output of food, once so highly valued in more than monetary terms, is now treated contemptuously as 'surplus' to requirements and fed to animals or exported at vast subsidy.
Rural myth and agricultural policy
The history of countryside policy has been based on the explicitly stated belief that agriculture is the most important rural activity economically, socially and environmentally, which of course justifies policies to support agriculture. The National Farmers Union (NFU), which has been a remarkably successful lobbying group, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), which is widely regarded as being the Ministry for Farmers, have made much of this argument over the years. In contrast, the countryside lobby has been diffuse, and, as will be shown, weakened by successive government actions that separated the amenity and access interests from the wildlife protection interests. Perhaps as befits a consumerist valuation of the countryside as identified by Hoggart et al. and described above, the consumers have found it difficult to organize and focus their lobbying power, or perhaps the diverse objectives of the estimated three-quarters of the urban population
who visit the countryside at least once a year do not lend themselves easily to pressure group politics. But the whole environmental movement in the UK has found it extremely difficult to have its views taken into serious account. "Significantly, the combination of government reluctance to act and a highly informed and active environmental lobby... means that Brussels receives more complaints relating to Britain's poor performance in implementing EC environmental legislation than any other state."^12 The British political system has not permitted the rise of a new environment-oriented political party, and the ill-named 'Department of the Environment (DOE)' has misled many into thinking that it somehow represents a government commitment to 'green' issues whereas it is, in fact, very largely a ministry for the built environment (housing, town planning, new towns, local government),^13 not for the natural environment which forms only a tiny part of its brief and budget. In no
way has the DOE performed a function for the conservation interests anything like that by MAFF for the NFU, and, as far as agriculture-related environmental issues are concerned, seems to have done a good job of supporting agricultural interests.

The agricultural depression of the 1870s onwards in the face of cheap cereal imports from the New World was only temporarily ameliorated by the First World War. The continuation of the agricultural support of the war years that brought three million acres back under the plough was promised, but the Agriculture Act of 1920 that incorporated those promises was repealed in 1921.^14 This was only one of many betrayals by the postwar government to provide the 'land fit for heroes.' Nevertheless, under the stimulus of high prices reflecting the world shortage of food caused by sharply reduced European production in the war years of about one-third, farmers expanded output in the 1920s, with the result that prices collapsed catastrophically. Prices in 1923 were almost half of their 1920 levels, and the decline continued to a low point in 1933. According to Bowers and Cheshire^15, "in the great depression the lack of investment and maintenance appalled The crumbling walls and
buildings, unkempt hedges and weed- (and flower-) infested fields led a contemporary writer to lament:
^14 Calder, op. cit.
^15 J K. Bowers and P Cheshire Agriculture, the Countryside and Land Use An Economic Critique London Methuen, 1983
Everywhere you find buildings in a deplorable state, roofs defective, doors broken down and the walls often affording but little shelter The farm roads are neglected and the farmyards in wet weather are deep in slush and liquid manure, the gates are patched up anyhow, and the fields often enough, with their vistas of weeds and rubbish, cry aloud for land drainage
Farmers' economic circumstances were shaping the countryside "
This perception of a countryside ravaged by a depressed agriculture was greatly influential in shaping agricultural and countryside policy after the Second World War Addison, the 'contemporary author' quoted above by Bowers and Cheshire was the minister implementing government intervention in agriculture, and he argued strongly in his Policy for Agriculture in 1939 that such intervention was justified on landscape grounds
There is one fact that never comes into agricultural talks, but which we ought not to forget The British landscape we love so much has been preserved by farming The pasturelands, the fields and hedges bespeak generations of loving care ...the neglect ...should help us to realise what things would be like if it were not for farming - thistles, nettles and weeds and all manner of rubbish spreading over good land offending the eye.^16
^16 Quoted in Bowers and Cheshire op. cit.
During World War II, there was a widespread determination that the social betrayal after World War I should not be repeated, and the post-war reconstruction policies were prepared very largely in war-time For agriculture, the influential document was the Scott Report on Land Utilisation in Rural Areas (1942) It embodied two important principles "first, that rural England was essential to the nations' cultural and landscape heritage, and, second, that agricultural prosperity was vital to the countryside In an equally famous passage, the Scott Report declared that 'the cheapest, indeed the only way, of preserving the countryside in anything like its traditional aspect, would be to farm it' "^17 The Report also "denounced the uncontrolled development in of land in the inter-war years," and " [the majority] opinion was that 'a radical alteration of the types of farming is not probable and no striking change in the pattern of the open countryside is to be expected ' Despite a
lucidly argued minority report disagreeing fundamentally with nearly all these basic conclusions, the Town and Country Planning Acts, on whose powers conservation heavily depended, reflected the majority attitude and were designed essentially to protect the countryside from the town The need to protect the countryside from threats from within - from farming and forestry - was not envisaged, and consequently no machinery was provided to deal with them "^19 However, the Scott Report also recommended that national parks and nature reserves should be established under the control of a central authority.

Underlying the rhetoric about stewardship is a very strong feeling by land-owning farmers that they have the right to do with their own land much as they will This attitude has its roots in the Roman law that forms the basis of land law in Britain and a number of other countries, and has been reinforced by the exclusion of agriculture from the planning controls of the post-World War II years That exclusion was of some significance because as Hodge^20 observed, "changes within agriculture, such as ploughing up pasture or removing hedges, do not fall within the definition of development as specified in the Town and Country Planning legislation which established the development control process." Thus farmers have retained far more rights over the way in which they use their land than have any other landowners. The policy emphasis put on food production since 1939,^21 and farmers' success in achieving massive output increases, together with the perceived strategic importance of
the sector (long after this had any basis in the reality of UK food security), gave farmers and agriculture a status (backed up by unprecedented relative income and wealth levels) that they had never before enjoyed. And since here was the prosperous agriculture that was the bedrock of a beautiful countryside, well, the countryside must also have benefited, mustn't it?

^21 This found its post-World War II expression in the Agriculture Act of 1947, and subsequent legislation, and was reinforced by UK entry into the EEC in 1973 and the integration into the Common Agricultural Policy.
Rural reality and conservation policy
Although the inter-war years saw some discussion at government level of the need for conservation policies through the creation of national parks to meet landscape preservation, access and nature conservation objectives, nothing was actually done despite repeated lobbying by the amenity groups. Following the Scott Report, a number of reports were prepared, the outcome of which was the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and the statutory establishment of the Nature Conservancy Council in the same year.
This government action thus consolidated a split in the conservation movement in Britain, which now had two distinct objectives. One was the protection and provision of access to natural landscapes for their scenic beauty and use for informal recreation, and the other was the protection of wildlife for research and education... both these main arms of the conservation movement have until recently been essentially preservationist in their priorities. The protection of the resource rather than its use, whether a National Park from tourism or a National Nature Reserve from wildfowling, or even bird-watching, have been the main objectives....
It would be wrong to give the impression that the preservationist and utilitarian streams of development in the conservation movement have been completely distinct. many of those concerned with protecting the environment have seen that a totally negative, purely preservationist policy can rarely succeed. Management is often essential to maintain that which it is desired to protect and in many cases only the controlled exploitation and use of natural ecosystems offers the chance of keeping them in a commercial world. Pragmatic views of this kind, particularly with respect to the role of farming in creating and maintaining much that has always been cherished in the British landscape and its flora and fauna, have characterised both arms of the conservation movement... Indeed, when the measures to establish a state system of conservation were being debated, and when the legislation was drawn up and enacted in 1949, farming was seen as a major force working for
conservation.^22

By the second half of the 1960s, there was the glimmering of an awareness that the interests of modem agricultural production - or more precisely of modem agricultural producers -and both wildlife and amenity conservation were starting to diverge, and that the existing legislative powers were - well, powerless! The Countryside Act 1968 was the government's half-hearted response, and attempted to tackle some of the problems of loss of heath, down and wetland in the National Parks (which says a lot about how effective the Park authorities had been in protecting their patches), as well as damage to the designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). Arguably, the most positive provision of the Act was to permit the Nature Conservancy Council to pay compensation to owners of SSSIs to manage the sites in a manner that would assure their continuing special scientific interest. But this created a number of problems, including moral hazard, it entrenched the principle that
compensation could be paid for not carrying out specified agricultural practices, and, given the complete inadequacy of funding, ensured that trade-offs would occur and some sites be abandoned to destruction.^23 However, the Act did establish the Countryside Commission as the statutory body to advise the government on countryside and landscape.
^23 The details of the SSSI implementation are slightly peripheral in the context of this chapter. However, they do illustrate the special problem of compensation not to do something environmentally damaging and the moral hazard of threat. A good reference is: C.L. Spash and I.A. Simpson. Utilitarian and Rights-based Alternatives for Protecting Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Journal of Agricultural Economics, 45 (1): 15-26, January 1994.
The incompatibility of agricultural and countryside goals grew more obvious during the 1970s as the full impact of the CAP was felt. Reports by the Countryside Commission and the Nature Conservancy Council, as well as by some of the voluntary bodies, played an important role in bringing home to government the new realities, and a new environmental dimension was brought to the forefront of discussion - pollution of soil and water by agriculture in the form of pesticides, herbicides, sheep dip, nitrates, silage effluent, liquid animal wastes, dairy washings and various feed additives, including heavy metals.^24
^24 The pesticides issue had in fact come up in the previous decade with regard to the effects of organochlorine compounds on wildlife and the food chain.
And here I wish to speak in the first person from my own experience. At the time, the late-1970s, I was involved in the preparation of a written submission to the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution covering the whole area of pollution from agriculture.^25 This required an examination of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, most notably the section on water pollution. It turned out that here too agriculture received special treatment. For a successful civil prosecution under the Act for polluting a watercourse, it would be necessary for the Water Authorities to show that "on the balance of probabilities" a particular action by a particular farmer had indeed been responsible for causing pollution within the meaning of the Act. However, if the farmer could demonstrate that the action in question was "good agricultural practice," that was an adequate defence. MAFF was supposed to be responsible for drawing up Codes of Practice, but in the meantime, it rather looked as if
the onus would be on the Water Authorities to prove that something was not "good agricultural practice." The Water Authorities also had to face dealing with the problems of non-point source and indirect pollution that characterise pollution from agriculture. In fact, the attitude of the Water Authorities was that only in the most flagrant and extreme cases were they interested in prosecuting farmers, preferring to visit, discuss, advise and generally find a consensual solution.
^25 See Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution.
"Collectively, [these reports] identified modem agriculture as responsible for far-reaching changes in the natural environment and challenged its privileged status as a largely unregulated contributor. to environmental change."^26 "Until recently those concerned with the damaging environmental impacts of [agricultural policy aimed at increasing production] have rarely questioned the need to grow more food. With the general revelations of the huge state support of the agricultural industry, the enormous surpluses and waste of food this has produced and the concern about diet and health, views have changed fundamentally.... Agriculture now finds itself under attack on all these grounds. Those who were not prepared to criticise the industry which provided their daily bread are much less happy about the destruction of the British countryside to provide cheap butter for Russians."^27

The most important expression of these concerns about the problems of agriculture and the environment was the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The two-year debate that led to its passage was marked by a vigorous conflict, with the agricultural lobby and MAFF taking a markedly defensive position in the face of what was perceived to be attack (and largely unjustified at that) by the conservation interests. Green^28 says of the Act that it "tackles the control of agriculture essentially through the principle of voluntary, fully compensated management agreements." While Buller^29 observes that it "was hailed as a victory by farmers, as it maintained the voluntary principle in regulating environmental impact." It is conceptually rather difficult to reconcile "control of agriculture" with "the voluntary principle," and this has led to some difficulties between Britain and the EC which has increasingly seen environmental regulation as being necessary to protect air, water and
soil quality. In fact, it was the European Community Drinking Water Directive of 1980 (Directive 80/788) that gave a high Community-wide and national profile to the problems of water pollution from agriculture, in particular because of the inability of many countries to meet the nitrate standards.

Agricultural and environmental objectives: towards integration?
The insistence on the principle of voluntary participation in environmental programmes is in line with the oft-repeated view of farmers as the guardians and stewards of the countryside, and agricultural production as the process for achieving countryside objectives.^30 But farmers are farmers and not conservation managers, so if the goals of agricultural and conservation policy conflict, they must not and cannot be forced to become what they are not.^31 Education, advice, training, persuasion - and of course full monetary compensation -are permissible and necessary, but if the horse won't drink when taken to water, there is nothing (except in the extreme case of SSSIs) that can be done about it.^32

And the compensation principle? The Town and Country Planning Act 1947 has had some influence here, although, as it was itself the product of a set of values and beliefs about both the benevolence of agriculture and the need to protect it from urban and industrial encroachment, it cannot be said to be the causal factor. Hodge^33 explains the Act very well:
^33 Hodge, op. cit.
[The] legislation... in effect nationalised the rights of landowners to develop their land. Once these rights were lost, owners had to apply to the local planning authority for permission if they wanted to undertake building works or major changes in land use...
The system has been the key mechanism in the process of urban containment, protecting agricultural land from urbanisation. The policy has been operated particularly strictly in areas of Green Belt which have been defined surrounding many major urban centres, but development in open countryside has also largely been prevented throughout the country except where a landowner can demonstrate that the proposed development is necessary for the purposes of agricultural production. Thus, by most accounts the policy has been particularly effective in giving considerable protection to the countryside.
It is important to note that the planning legislation, when it "nationalised development rights," did not include any compensation principle for the loss of those development rights, which included agricultural land. Indeed, subsequent tax legislation was introduced to deter or penalise speculation in land development rights What it did do was to exempt agricultural practices from the definitions of development and change in land use. Any attempt now to control or restrict agricultural 'development' or changes in agricultural practices is therefore seen as requiring compensation There has, however, been some strong public reaction against paying farmers not to do something, and (with the exception of SSSIs as we shall see later) farmers in general have not been too happy about the idea, not least because of the blow to their self-esteem and pride as farmers. The introduction of voluntary schemes that have environmental management objectives, so that the compensation payment,
while being based on foregone agricultural income, can nevertheless be presented as a payment for environmental services rendered (the production of public goods in economic terms), can be viewed as a vital component in the integration of agricultural and environmental policy objectives. It can also be viewed as a cosmetic device for masking yet more payments to farmers while showing a 'green' face to the public. Either way, the underlying British approach is contractual rather than regulatory.
The British concerns about agriculture and the environment are increasingly having to find expression within the EU policy framework. That necessarily reflects a broader and often quite different set of values and beliefs about not only agricultural and environmental matters but also the whole question of the rural environment and rural development.^34 Strong regional and national differences have emerged, with implications for priorities, policy objectives and policy implementation. On the one hand, there is the 'greening of the CAP,' which attempts to modify agricultural policy to allow for some incorporation of environmental objectives where a public good argument can be made. On the other, there is environmental legislation that impinges on agricultural practices. Both policy thrusts are relatively recent and to some extent still embryonic. However, optimists would rejoice that the principle has finally been established that agricultural policy objectives can no longer
be pursued to the exclusion of other policy objectives. Pessimists might feel uneasy that the agricultural policy objectives that have proved so inimical to conservation considerations hitherto have not been abandoned.

Contemporary policies for countryside management^36
^36 There have been a number of piecemeal agricultural policy measures with some conservation orientation, such as the Farm and Conservation Grant Scheme, the Organic Aid Scheme, the Moorland Scheme, the Countryside Access Scheme and the Farm Woodland Scheme. This chapter does not attempt an exhaustive survey.
In 1985, Article 19 of EC Regulation 797/85 authorised governments to make payments to farmers in nationally designated areas for carrying out defined management practices to achieve environmental objectives (Only 25 percent of the scheme costs were met by the EU). A pilot scheme to conserve the Norfolk Broads grazing marshes was started by the Countryside Commission in the same year, and Section 18 of the Agriculture Act 1986 permitted designation of a number of Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) in Great Britain, such as the Somerset Levels (a wetland environment) and the chalk down-lands of the South Downs. Participation is available to all farmers in the designated area of the ESA, originally for five but later changed to ten years. At its simplest, a flat-rate annual payment is made in return for adherence to a set of agreed management practices. However, the ESA scheme permits 'tiers' of payment to achieve different environmental objectives ranging from maintenance
of existing conditions to reinstatement of former landscapes or habitats or creation of new ones.^37 In order to broaden the environmental and geographical scope of the ESA scheme, the Countryside Commission launched a new scheme in 1991, revealingly titled 'Countryside Stewardship.' with the aim of improving and conserving "landscape and scenic beauty, wildlife habitats, history and archaeology and to provide opportunities for people to enjoy the countryside."^38 The scheme targets particular types of landscape, rather than designated areas, and operates through a series of measures: "annual payments that support the enhanced management of existing areas of each landscape, or their restoration or re-creation; supplementary payments for more costly and sophisticated regeneration of landscapes and for the provision of new or improved public access; and capital funds for a wide range of landscape improvements and other work related to the specific landscape types."^39 The
interim evaluation found that Countryside Stewardship "has been successful in targeting its resources to landscape types and geographical areas that offer great potential for environmental improvement and public benefit and in some target areas very high uptake has been achieved."^40 It was transferred to MAFF in 1996 after a five-year pilot period as "the core of England's agro-environmental programme."^41

Under yet another experimental scheme, the "Countryside Premium Scheme in East Anglia, set-aside was turned into new habitats, including alternative feeding areas for Brent geese... and public access areas were established creating meadow walks around villages previously hemmed in by intensive arable land."^42 This scheme involved topping up the set-aside payments available from the EC for land set-aside for the purposes of supply reduction in order to gain some environmental benefits. So in addition to the payment for not producing cereals, participating farmers were able to receive additional payments for producing some environmental goods, not all of which materialised: "While the scheme as a whole appears to have met its general objective of an improved environment and greater capacity for quiet public recreation... not all projects achieved their aims. For example, pastures for goose grazing were little used by the Brent geese when the sward height was allowed to exceed
9 cm... and a chalk grassland restoration project included a wide range of species from European and garden origin and so failed to restore the local flora, although it was a successful creation of a pleasant public access area."^43

The recent EU agri-environmental legislation will permit the continuation of most of the British initiatives, and will increase the Community contribution to their cost to 50 percent (75 percent in regions covered by Article 1 of the Structural Funds). It also allows for a variety of other schemes that accord more with the priorities of other EU countries. The relevant measures are one of the 'Accompanying Measures' to the 1992 reform of the CAP: 2078/92, Council Regulation on Agricultural Production Methods compatible with the requirements of the Protection of the Environment and the Maintenance of the Countryside.^44
^44 The other two Accompanying Measures 2080/92 and 2079/92 deal with forestry in agriculture and an early retirement package. The British have decided not to implement the latter which would in practice probably have substantial negative environmental impacts in the British context.
The aims of this measure are as follows: to reduce the polluting effects of agriculture; to encourage environmentally favourable extensification of crops and livestock; to protect the countryside; to recover abandoned land; to set up environmentally beneficial long-term set-aside; to facilitate public access to land; and to educate farmers and landowners on agri-environmental matters.
These objectives may be brought about in any of the following ways: by reducing fertiliser use; by farming organically, by using other means of extensification, by reducing the number of sheep or cattle per forage area; by using farming practices which protect the environment and the countryside; by rearing rare breeds of animals; by ensuring the upkeep of abandoned land; by putting land into 20-year set-aside; and by facilitating public access to land.^45

This document includes both the written and oral evidence in full of the main conservation and amenity groups as well as farming bodies such as the NFU.
The agri-environmental measures have been fairly well received in Britain by the countryside and conservation groups, and also by the NFU, for bringing environmental objectives into the mainstream of agricultural policy and for funding them under the CAP budget. There is also widespread approval of the decentralised approach that has been adopted: most of the measures are to be developed and implemented at a regional level by means of five-year zonal programmes, and no detailed Community framework will be provided. Nevertheless, it is recognised that this raises problems as well as creating opportunities:
It will be important to ensure that this regionalised approach is successful in practice. Member States should not be permitted to avoid implementing the necessary measures or only to implement them in an ineffective, minimalist fashion. Furthermore, it is important that the latitude provided... is used for environmental benefits and that the proposed schemes are not simply regarded as an additional farm support measure...
... there must be some doubt about the mixed objectives of the agri-environmental package, which attempts to combine environmental concerns with reducing production. It is clear that reduced output in a particular area may benefit the environment, but it is not legitimate to conclude that "...measures to reduce agricultural production in the Community must have a beneficial impact on the environment" as is stated in the preamble to the draft Regulation. It is important to establish clear environmental objectives within agriculture and to devise effective ways of achieving these objectives, rather than attaching them to supply control policies.^46
^46 Institute for European Environmental Policy (IEEP), Green or Mean? Assessing the Environmental Value of the CAP Reform "Accompanying Measures." Report prepared for the Council for the Protection of Rural England and submitted in evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities, op. cit.
The question of set-aside land brings into sharp focus the ongoing conflict between agricultural and environmental policy objectives. Set-aside is a supply control measure, and the so-called environmental cross-compliance conditions are very much secondary and subordinate to that purpose. The original proposals did not allow for the 20-year set-aside under the agri-environmental measures to count towards the 15 percent then required for rotational set-aside under the supply reduction scheme. However, the Council of Ministers agreed in June 1995 that in future "arable land taken out of production under agri-environment schemes, currently the Nitrate Sensitive Areas and Habitat Schemes, and forestry schemes could count against farmers' set-aside obligations."^47 The practical implications of this concession are not yet clear.
^47 Rural England, op. cit.
The budget allocated for the agri-environmental measures should give cause for concern about the priority accorded to environmental objectives: it averages about 400 million ECU a year for five years, which represents about one percent of the total FEOGA budget. It can be argued that many EU countries have little experience in implementing suitable schemes, and so the absorptive capacity in the early years should not be over-stretched, nor should there be encouragement to dream up quite inappropriate and environmentally unhelpful schemes just to get more Brussels money for farmers. There are some searing memories of CAP fraud, and there is every reason to suppose that such ingenuity has not declined over the years. There is also the legitimate concern that the real budgetary constraint is more likely to be at the national level. Of perhaps even greater importance is whether the Commission have the resources and expertise in the Agriculture and Environment Directorates to
screen proposals adequately to prevent fraud and ensure their technical soundness.
But the smallness of the agri-environmental budget is of itself only part of the problem: the vast majority of CAP expenditure is still going to support agricultural production in ways that are at odds with countryside and natural resource protection. It has been accepted that farmers should be paid for the production of environmental goods and services: it has not been openly acknowledged that the cost of achieving any given level of those goods and services is greatly inflated because of the agricultural support prices. Valuing public goods is by its nature very difficult, but one recent study^48 used a contingent valuation method to compare public benefits with net exchequer costs of the scheme for two ESAs, the South Downs and the Somerset Levels. The benefit-cost ratios for user benefits were 50.2 and 5.8, and for total benefits including passive use were 82.3 and 28.4. This would suggest that the levels of provision of public goods are far from adequate (and this
finding is supported by other studies of environmental goods), and that they are even more inadequate if the high costs of agricultural support that inflate the cost side of the calculation are taken into account.

Water pollution from agriculture: What happened to the polluter pays principle?
The UK takes the question of water pollution from agriculture rather more seriously now than it did in the 1970s, but is the same true of the 'Polluter Pays Principle' (PPP), which is supposed to form the basis of pollution control measures in OECD countries and is incorporated in Article 130R of the Treaty of Rome? Different approaches have been taken with regard to nitrate pollution, pollution from farm wastes and pesticides.
Britain has introduced an experimental scheme based on the designation of Nitrate Sensitive Areas, based, unsurprisingly, on the principles of voluntarism and compensation.
Ten such areas to combat nutrient enrichment in 1990 were identified by the [National Rivers Authority] and designated by [MAFF] under the Water Act 1989. Their purpose is to help control the entry of nitrates into controlled waters from agricultural land by payments to farmers to reduce nitrate use. Twenty-two new areas were introduced in July 1994. Consideration is being given to extending the life of the original ten areas for a further five years.^49 (My emphasis.)
Farmers are offered compensation on an annual basis in return for changes in management, including limits on fertiliser application, an obligation to minimise the area Of bare land in the winter and better management of organic manure. In each NSA, a basic scheme and a more restrictive 'premium' scheme is offered to farmers with compensation based on expected reductions in income. ^50

It is obvious that, in some modified form, the UK government is intending to use this approach as part of its package of schemes within the framework of the agri-environmental measures (2078/92) under the heading of reducing the polluting effects of agriculture. Yet how does the Nitrate Sensitive Areas scheme marry with the obligations under the EC Nitrates Directive which is aimed at bringing drinking water quality up to standard? Even with the scheme in place and other measures taken by the water companies, Britain has not enforced the EC limit on nitrates in drinking water in some parts of the country, and charges have been brought in the European Court. A more recent Directive (1991) is specifically aimed at controlling nitrate pollution from agricultural sources
In the summer of 1994 the government consulted interested parties on the establishment of 70 Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, under the European Community Nitrates Directive. These are areas of land which dram into surface water or into aquifers. The [National Rivers] Authority has assisted in the formulation of the Government consultative proposals for implementing the European Community Nitrates Directive, advising on the methodology, providing water quality data and suggesting boundaries for the vulnerable zones. Action programmes to control the nitrate contribution from agriculture will become compulsory within these zones without compensatory payments^51 (My emphasis)
^51 National Audit Office, 1995, op. cit.
Following designation, the government has two years to draw up action plans and a further four years to implement them It is far from clear what package of measures will be selected, and even less clear what sorts of measure might be effective in achieving the quality standards And if effective, then politically acceptable.^52 The government has announced that it intends to re-introduce capital grants (presumably under the Farm and Conservation Grant Scheme) for farmers in areas designated as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. Unless animal wastes are a major source of nitrate pollution in those areas, it is not immediately obvious what the capital grants would be used for. At the time of writing, the lack of information on government thinking about reconciling the two approaches, and its intentions with respect to controlling nitrate pollution in the long term leave this issue as an open question.
^52 A number of studies have looked at some of the economic instruments that might be able to achieve the objectives - there is serious doubt about the efficacy of the obvious one, which is to tax nitrogen usage Some alternatives are proposed in:

Farm wastes have been dealt with by a combination of regulatory, educational and advisory approaches, supplemented by a system of capital grants. No measures have been thought necessary to limit intensive livestock production in particular areas, but there are controls over the building standards and design of the installation of new units, particularly with regard to animal waste management. The Water Resources Act 1991 gave statutory duties and powers to the National Rivers Authority^53 (NRA) for water resources and pollution control inter aha, and, in addition to responding to pollution incidents and taking action against polluters, it can recover costs, and engage in pollution prevention activities In 1993 in England, agriculture accounted for 11 percent of all substantiated pollution incidents, and the proportion of reported farm pollution incidents has fallen both absolutely and relatively since 1985, despite easier reporting procedures. Nevertheless, it is admitted
that the low population density in agricultural areas means that there is under-reporting.
^53 Under the Environment Act 1995, the National Rivers Authority was combined sometime in 1996 with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution and waste regulation authorities to form a new Environment Agency for England and Wales. Since all documents cited refer to the NRA, that is the organization referred to throughout this chapter.
The DOE, in consultation with MAFF, produced the Control of Pollution (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) Regulations in 1991, which govern the storage of farm waste, and MAFF publish Codes of Good Agricultural Practice. The Regulations set minimum standards for all new waste storage facilities and for older ones that are substantially enlarged or reconstructed. The then-commercialised Agricultural Development and Advisory Service^54 (ADAS) acted on behalf of MAFF in carrying out free pollution visits, either of a general advisory nature or for assistance in drawing up a farm waste management plan. Preventive work is carried out by the NRA through targeted farm visits. Among the criteria used in targeting a catchment are: "failure to meet set water quality standards; a history of pollution incidents; the risk to water sources; areas of high conservation value; and public opinion." Farm visits are also made in response to requests for advice, following up on reported
incidents, and as part of the approval process for grant applications under MAFF's Farm and Conservation Grant Scheme. (Between 1989 and 1994, 11,000 proposals were approved in principle.)
^54 ADAS was originally the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service of MAFF. After its commercialisation, ADAS undertook statutory work on behalf of MAFF, most notably in the areas of conservation and environment. In late 1996, steps were taken to privatise ADAS, and it is understood that at this point ADAS ceased to carry out statutory work for MAFF, certain of the officers being transferred back to MAFF for this purpose prior to the sell-off.
Under the scheme farmers were required to obtain the approval of the Authority for farm waste facilities on which they sought grant before the Ministry would provide funding. Grant was available for the provision, replacement or improvement of facilities for handling, storage and disposal of agricultural waste and effluent.
In November 1993 the rate of grant payable was reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent of eligible work costs and in November 1994 the Ministry announced that grants would be discontinued with immediate effect.^55
^55 Ibid.
The involvement of the NRA in scheme planning and approval has been an important pollution prevention instrument whose effects are likely to be long-reaching because of the well-planned investment in farm waste facilities. However, there may be a danger that the withdrawal of capital grants could weaken the NRA's preventive role, although it still has strong powers under the Regulations. The NRA has shown itself to be willing to take action against farm polluters: in a sample of 100 incidents, eight were dealt with by prosecution, eight by formal caution,^56 79 by remedial action and five were unsubstantiated. The National Audit Office^57 found that the actions appeared to be appropriate. Certainly the NRA is careful in the prosecutions it does bring because the proportion of convictions is between 95 percent and 99 percent.
^56 "Formal cautions are used by the National Rivers Authority following less severe incidents in order to get the farmer to acknowledge the offence and take steps to reduce the chance of further pollution offences. The Authority also uses them where it believes prosecution could be counter-productive in view of remedial action taken by the farmer. To issue a caution the Authority must have the same degree of evidence as for a prosecution and the polluter must admit to the offence and accept the caution. Should the person offend again and be prosecuted, the existence of previous cautions will be disclosed to the court." Ibid.
^57 National Audit Office, 1995, op. cit.
Interestingly enough, the NRA does have the power to make the polluter pay: the cost-recovery forced on government agencies in the Thatcher years has in this case over-ridden an inherent government aversion to the polluter pays principle where the polluter in question is a farmer. The NRA emphasises that its main aim in bringing a prosecution is the award of costs. However, "where no criminal proceedings are involved the Authority can seek, under the Water Resources Act 1991, to recover the costs (defined in the Act as 'expenses') from the polluter for works and operations carried out to remedy pollution."^58 In cases of course where the polluter can be identified. There has been some uncertainty about whether the costs associated with the investigation of an incident, which are often very high, can be recovered under the existing legislation. The NRA policy is that they can and must, and the position was expected to be clarified in subsequent legislation.
^58 "Ibid.
With regard to the question of pollution from pesticides, the government should be allowed to state its 'position' in its own words:
In order to further our policy on the use of pesticides we will hold a conference... to help us develop an Action Plan... Features of the Action Plan are likely to include:
∑ working with farmers, growers, retailers, consumers and other organizations to encourage widespread adoption of pesticide minimisation techniques;
∑ promoting these techniques through formal and ad hoc training, guidance and the extension services;
∑ investigating and promoting the opportunities afforded by new technology and research;
∑ reporting progress annually to the Advisory Committee on Pesticides.^59
^59 Rural England op. cit.
It is perhaps some comfort to know that the NRA has obtained approval to establish a National Centre for Toxic and Persistent Substances, and intends to undertake a systematic review of the potential impact and likelihood of pesticides entering natural waters. On the other hand, there is little comfort in the reliance of the Action Plan on the 'extension services', which have been privatised.
Revealed beliefs and values
Let us now consider what the history of agriculture-related environmental policy in Britain might be able to tell us about the underlying beliefs ("persuasion of the truth of something"^60) and values ("moral principles or standards"^61) about the rural environment. In the first place, it is surprisingly difficult to unravel the tangled relationship between values, beliefs and the rural mythos that together constitute a belief system. The moral standards that we know as values are not exogenously determined, and they have been attached to, as well as shaped by, a particular set of beliefs about a mythical rural reality by a non-rural, largely middle-class, electorate. Secondly, it is even more difficult to identify the values referred to with any precision because they inhere in a myth that is more felt than articulated. In this belief system, the farmer is given a quasi-priestly role as custodian and steward of that set of values embodied - both by belief and by definition
-in the 'traditional rural way of life' as proxied by the 'countryside.' (This pseudo-mystical terminology is not accidental.) Thus values and beliefs about the environment were for a long time assumed to be adequately catered for predominantly through the medium of agricultural policy in all its manifestations, a state of affairs encouraged by farmers and landowners. Conversely, the numinous values and beliefs underlying agricultural policy (as expounded by Michel Petit) have had an infinitely greater carrying power hitherto. That belief system has been under severe and increasing stress since the 1960s, not, it must be said, because the 'traditional rural way of life' has been exposed for the myth that it undoubtedly is (after all, the mythos has a vital role to play culturally, socially and psychologically).
^60 Chambers English Dictionary.
^61 Ibid.
One important reason is that the reality of rural life, and most especially the reality of modem industrial agriculture, is so far from providing a satisfactory or satisfying representation of the values embodied in the myth, that the associated beliefs about farming and the countryside are being falsified. And herein lies a possible explanation for the demonisation of the farmer: he is perceived as having betrayed the sacred trust of his sacerdotal role by 'desecrating' (the word is frequently used, and that is very revealing) the countryside. The policy response has been to refocus countryside concerns through the lens of environmental policies that nevertheless still operate through the means of the farmer, reflecting a growing belief that the farmer is a policy-responsive, economic agent whose actions must be directed and controlled to ensure a socially acceptable outcome. On top of all this, the farmer is going to be held accountable for those actions or non-actions.
This belief encourages the relationship between farmer and society to be seen as contractual, rather than coercive: policy measures are implemented wherever possible through management agreements and compensation, and the farmer is still granted a stewardship role albeit one that is far less exalted and subject to proof of good conduct.
Another reason is that the values themselves are being questioned, ironically enough because a new awareness of certain aspects of rural reality is making the rural myth seem very much less appealing. The most widely publicised expression of this is the anti-blood sports movement by animal rights activists of all persuasions from mild to violent. 'Field sports' (hunting and shooting) are under attack as cruelty to animals (violence), and the first line of defence is that they are a vital part of the 'traditional rural way of life.' However, the new rural population (as described in my comments on Wilkin's paper) are in many small ways objecting to several traditional rural practices, such as the ringing of church bells and the keeping of cockerels (noisy), pig farming and muck spreading (smelly), silage clamps (ugly and smelly). The 'quality of life' that many rural incomers seek has nothing whatsoever to do with rural traditions and a great deal to do with a reaction
against the perceived noisiness, smelliness, ugliness and violence of contemporary urban life. The policy response to such value challenges is legislative and regulatory, the measures being implemented; through fines, restrictions and prohibitions.
It would be unwise to try to draw general inferences on the basis of a few specific cases - and indeed the ambiguous policy response to nitrate pollution of water courses would give the immediate lie to any such attempt - but there could be a certain poetry in trying to achieve moral standards by the imposition of legal standards, and to use persuasive (agreement and compensation) methods to cater for beliefs about truth and reality. Yet it is in policy objectives not their delivery systems that values and beliefs need to make themselves felt, and it is far from obvious that either the UK government or the European Commission have come to grips with this as far as the environment and agriculture is concerned.
It is the stated intention of the European Commission and the Council of Ministers that the new EU agri-environmental measures should enable every farmer in the Union to do something that is somehow environmentally friendly, and to be paid for it. Since each country individually can choose with very few restrictions what agri-environmental measures are most appropriate, it is tempting to think that the unthinkable has happened: the tremendous divergences of environmental values and beliefs across western Europe have been accommodated in one simple piece of enabling legislation based on the compensation principle. In fact, I should argue that the environmental concern has been quite effectively hijacked by agricultural interests. The agri-environmental measures are not a real expression of society's willingness to pay for a public good, for a majority public value, (or even for a minority value) or for a realisation of a belief about the importance of a particular
environmental issue. They are using the excuse of environmental values and beliefs to justify new farm support payments, and the inclusion of payments for environmental goods and services in the agriculture budget, not in the environment budget, is a clear indication of the danger - and one that has implications for future trade negotiations. Historically, the values and beliefs underlying agricultural policy have taken precedence over any environmental ones. Although we have seen a fundamental change in the official recognition of environmental concerns as a legitimate aspect of agricultural policy, the latter continues to have an overwhelming primacy. As long as the imbalance is so great, and the underlying power blocs so unevenly balanced, it is going to be difficult for agriculture-related environmental values and beliefs to be adequately articulated, let alone find effective political expression.
The foregoing discussion has focused explicitly on the values and beliefs underlying English attitudes towards agriculture and the rural environment. Even within the different parts of the UK, the story is different. Within western Europe, history, tradition, geography and a whole range of other factors have shaped the attitudes to and the expression of rural environmental concern. Hoggart et al. ^62 have studied many of these factors for the current EU member countries, and it is worth quoting their findings at length as they provide a useful framework for structuring our thinking about:
∑ the different values and beliefs within and between EU member states, and how these can be given expression in environmental, rural and agricultural policies; and
∑ the issues that are going to be of importance in and for the aspiring member countries of central and eastern Europe.
^62 Hoggart et al., op. cit.
Reasons for the emergence of environmental concern in agriculture reveal nine distinct themes:
1. an ecological concern for the impact of intensification upon ecosystems;
2. a concern for the public health implications of resource contamination;
3. a concern for the farming sector's relative freedom from regulatory constraint;
4. a concern for the amenity value of the countryside;
5. a concern for access to rural areas threatened by intensification of agricultural land-use;
6. a concern that local economic development could be hindered by agricultural monopolisation;
7. a concern to limit agricultural surpluses generated by intensification;
8. a concern to improve farm incomes by diversifying farm activities into landscape protection;
9. an ethical concern for a declining sense of environmental responsibility that is considered inherent in contemporary agricultural policy.
These concerns are not universally present in rural Europe. Indeed, it is here that we might begin to identify distinct trajectories which mirror varied national and local conceptions of the role of agriculture within contemporary rural space and, inter alia, differing patterns of rural economic and social change. Significantly, such trajectories bear witness to an overall sense of decline in the position of agriculture within Europe's rural regions.^63
^63 Hoggart et al. op. cit.
During the discussions between western and central Europeans at this seminar three other concerns emerged to add to Hoggart's list:
∑ a concern for the human health implications of modem agricultural practices;
∑ a concern to protect one's own grassroots territory (pays, paysage - the fact that there is no adequate English translation of this French concept tells its own story!) from the undesirable consequences of agricultural development;
∑ a concern for the detrimental effects of industrial pollution on the quality and quantity of agricultural production.
Environmental matters in general may not yet have a very high priority in the transition economies, and indeed they do not in all EU countries. However, the nature of the EU agri-environmental measures, which enable rather than enforce and compensate rather than penalise, is such that it is hard to see them as a source of conflict between the EU and the aspirant members. On the contrary, they seem to be more likely to offer encouragement to the development of a concern for the relationship between agriculture and the environment since such concern can be translated into material rewards.
A much trickier area, and a source of potential conflict, is that of environmental regulation that impinges on agricultural practice and income, such as the Nitrate Directive, or problems posed by specific issues or geographical areas that require governmental action, especially where trade is affected or the environmental impacts cross international boundaries. Water pollution, animal health and human health spring to mind as examples. In such cases, there will have to be pragmatic policy responses that are not necessarily supported and carried by deeply held values and beliefs about agriculture and the environment. The question then is not whether the values and beliefs of west and east clash, but whether in their absence a political consensus can be obtained and maintained to implement unpopular policies.
Protecting the rural environment: A commentary
by Csaba Csaki
Environment is an area where Central East Europeans have to learn. My remarks are divided in two parts. First, I will make some general observations about agriculture-related environmental problems in the region, mainly based on Hungarian examples. Second, some comments are made on the paper.
Agriculture-related environmental problems represent probably one of those areas where the values and beliefs in the region are quite far from the current West European values and beliefs. In the region environmental problems have been discussed continuously. The environmental concerns related to agriculture or landscape, however, had not played a significant role in any agricultural policy decision, and there are no strong grassroots-based environmental movements either.
What are the reasons? We have to go back to the pre-reform period. The fact that the land became depersonalised in the command economies made a very strong impact on the attitude toward environmental problems related to land and agriculture. In Western Europe, we always talk about farmers and the polluters and say they should pay for the damage. Who was the polluter in Central Europe? De facto, the state was the polluter since it ran the whole economy. As a result the problem gets a new dimension and the whole environmental problem area became part of the planned economy.
Central European countries under communism implemented very advanced environmental laws, generally copying West European laws. These laws were, however, implemented under the planned system. State-owned enterprises were not supposed to pollute, but if it could be shown to be in the interest of the national economy, it was easily forgiven. For example, animal waste was often put into the local river. Unless it went into the village where the population was directly affected, the Environmental Agency trying to implement the regulation got a letter from the Planning Bureau saying, "We 'have' to keep this unit running, we don't have clean-up money; therefore, it is in the interest of the national economy to let the unit continue to run without paying any penalties."
The implementation of environmental rules was light and loose. There were no real farmers who were concerned about land, just the large farms, with management not personally related to the land. Generally, even if there was a fine, it was forgiven because it was accepted that the offending farm was beneficial to society. In Hungary, the Balaton Lake area has one of the largest bauxite deposits in Europe. Mining caused tremendous environmental damage by lowering the water table level. As a result, a large thermal basin nearby was almost destroyed. The damage to agriculture was also great. It took quite a long time to change this situation.
Another important factor was that the former system really did not tolerate grassroot based actions. Activities such as protesting for the environment were considered very suspicious. Even organizing anything which was not part of the overall framework was politically suspicious; therefore, it was very difficult to express local environmental interest. It is also very interesting that in practically all the countries the first really visible and strong demonstrations against the old political system happened under environmental slogans. Environmental problems were used to express dissident views and to demand political change. Hungary was a very good example of this. The joint dam project with Czechoslovakia became the focus of the first political demonstrations and demand for more pluralism and change in the Hungarian political system.
Unfortunately, this relationship of environmental issues to politics also contributed to the fact that most of the environmental movements discredited themselves very quickly after the political change took place. Most of them were not able to recognise the new political situation and looked at environmental problems objectively. They remained extremist, forcing for example, the Hungarian Government into a very unfortunate policy regarding the dam.
There now are new developments in the environmental movement, but because public awareness, in general, is not very strong and the environment is not a major issue, there are no strong environmental movements anywhere in the region. There are no significant environment-oriented 'green' parties as well.
A closer examination indicates that modem agriculture has all the same impacts on the environment in the East as in the West. It has more or less the same technology, so the damages and impacts are also similar. The ecological system is somewhat different, but the problems are identical: water pollution, animal waste pollution and various sorts of erosion and soil damage. The impacts of the large scale animal production units with improper animal waste treatment are more serious in the region than in Western Europe. When the region, and Hungary, left the previous system there was a heritage of water pollution, damage from animal wastes and soil problems. The latter is not so serious in Hungary because this is a relatively flat land that is not very sensitive to water erosion and has no wind erosion. Hungary has water erosion, but only in some hilly areas, not like Africa or in some parts of Russia.
The transition to a market has had both positive and negative impacts. The positive impact is the drastic decline in the use of chemicals. Central European countries used to apply three hundred kilograms of active fertiliser ingredients per hectare while two years ago the average application in Hungary was only 80 kilograms. In addition to having no money for fertiliser, many farmers decided to experiment with using no fertiliser or pesticides. Plus, in 1993, 1.5 million hectares remained uncultivated because people were debating who owned it and how the land should be divided. Intensive technology was not used on most of the land. The soil and water, therefore, got some relief in this period, which is definitely positive from an environmental point of view. On the other side, it is quite clear that there was also a strong negative impact, and now it is more clear than a year ago. The weed control situation became very unsatisfactory in some areas. Even ragweed came back
after twenty years because the private farmers did not use any pesticides. Their grandfathers didn't use any so they thought it was not necessary. The various technologies that the new farmers did use sometimes were more damaging to the soil than earlier. In the West locusts have been forgotten, but last year Hungary again had locusts in some areas. That is because the use of control technologies have broken down. On the whole, soil productivity decreased and the yields went down dramatically.
The change loosened up a lot of things, partly good partly bad. But I think, at least in Hungary, there is once more a growing awareness of the necessity of using a certain set of agricultural technological procedures in a consistent package. The Government has introduced environmentally focused legislation and began to provide payments for those who are using environmentally friendly methods. There is a grant system to support the introduction of environmentally friendly technologies, especially to support the upgrading of livestock waste management and waste treatment. It is quite interesting and characteristic of the current situation that last year in the Hungarian Government budget almost everything was over spent - except grants for environmental investments. About 40 percent of the grants were not used. It shows that the farms put priority on other investments because there are grant systems for other productivity enhancing investment as well, and those are fully
used.
In Hungary and in other Central European countries there is much more talk about the EU environmental actions and what is going on in the EU than what is going on in their own countries. The EU sets the standard for the region. The positive side is that the countries know what standards they have to meet. There are at the same time new concerns related to the impacts of European environmental concerns on trade. Many fear that when trade negotiations move ahead, the environment, like animal rights issues, will become a cover for new protectionism.
There was an unfortunate event two years ago, created by France, when Hungarian goose liver imports were stopped for a couple of months. France claimed that the Hungarians harassed the geese in the feeding process. In that year there was over production of goose liver in France. After two months the barriers were removed since, by that time, producers had sold all of their domestic goose liver. The impact of the ban on the Hungarian industry was serious, especially in the private sector. Many producers went bankrupt because of the delays and the low price resulting from the French action.
Another important issue is the border area environmental protection. Pollution, animal disease and a lot of other things are coming over from the eastern Hungarian borders. There is talk about developing a new environmental and animal health monitoring system along the eastern boundary, which is mainly Ukraine and Romania. It is a positive attitude acknowledging that if Hungary will join the EU, it has a responsibility to protect the whole community.
A few comments on the paper
The first section on the history of the British countryside movement is really interesting to read. What is really different in Central Europe is the discontinuity in this whole process. In this region few people even have their parents' property. It is a very important fact to consider. The region has been living in a very uncertain political and economic environment during the last fifty years. During the past half century the system has changed upside down four times. The officially stated values and the beliefs have changed repeatedly. As a result the main belief is - do not believe in anything until you can see what is good for you.
One of the most difficult tasks is to recreate the belief, of the people in themselves, and recreate the belief in a system that works for them. There was a survey in the region recently, asking people about the government. Two questions were asked: (a) do you believe that the government can improve your situation; and (b) do you believe that you can improve your situation? In Hungary 80 percent said "no" regarding the government, while 60 percent said they might be able to improve their situations. The same questions were asked in the Czech Republic, where the result was not exactly the same. In the Czech Republic more people believe in the government than in Hungary.
What allowed these people in these countries to survive was the 'not-believing approach.' It is now very difficult to create a situation where people believe what they are told because what they heard in the past was not always true. They knew it; therefore, they had a double life. This is important in shaping attitudes concerning the environment as well.
The other comment is about rural areas. Hungary is probably not the best example because here communism, in a way, was better for rural areas than for towns. While in general the urban areas were subsidised, the rural areas received more economic freedom, which resulted in faster development. In general urban areas were treated differently. Even in Hungary up to 1989 electricity in urban areas cost half what it cost in rural areas. The housing was almost free in urban areas, while rural people had to build their own houses because there were very limited rural state housing projects. The rural-urban transportation was practically free. The benefit to rural people was modest because they did not travel to urban areas. There were virtually no telephones in rural areas, limited infrastructure, few shops, and fewer services. After the fall of communism, however, the urban people have suffered more than the rural people.
In the West, consumers have found it difficult to organize and focus their lobbying power. This is true in this region as well. What is needed very much in Hungary is a much stronger consumer lobby. There also is a need for some kind of agricultural policy council to co-ordinate the various interests.
The paper speaks about UK. environmental movements. There is no country in Central and Eastern Europe where there is an environmental or 'green' party in the parliament. In Hungary, there is a party which mix the 'green' with certain fascist ideas. This party got 0.1 percent of the vote in the last election.
It is very interesting to learn about environmental legislation and rules. In Central Europe, there are no problems with the legislation - the problem is in the implementation. There is no enforcement, except for very extreme cases.
Group discussion on "The rural environment"
The discussion of the policies on environment centred on two separate, but potentially related, issues; the situation, beliefs, and values in Central Europe and policy directions in Western Europe.
It was pointed out that in Poland there has been a great deal of concern and considerable activity to improve what were clearly major environmental problems. There have been major programmes to reduce water pollution, to develop rural infrastructure including rural sewers, to increase the area of national parks and protected areas, and put other public policies in place that would make up for years of environmental neglect. These activities have been financed by internal funds, World Bank loans, debt forgiveness programmes of foreign governments, and grants from Western Europe. The result of these activities has been an appreciable improvement in some areas.
These activities to improve the environment in rural Poland have involved public activities and funding external to the areas concerned. Farmers have been nearly oblivious to the potential impact that their activities could have on the environment, and no policies have been developed to attempt to modify farmers' practices.
No 'green party' has emerged in Poland and there is no politically strong environmental group. In fact, the government technocrats have been the primary leaders in developing the environmental activities that have been undertaken.
It was pointed out that the beliefs and values under the old system resulted in serious damage to the rural environment in the Czech Republic. The belief that the state was responsible for social utility meant that no one took any personal responsibility for actions that damaged the environment. In addition, the depersonalisation of land ownership meant that no one was concerned or responsible for the major problems created by the farm consolidation and shift to large scale production.
The result of this heritage is major problems of soil erosion, widespread soil compaction, inadequate control of animal wastes from large-scale production facilities and severe water pollution.
The parliament of the Czech Republic passed new environmental regulations shortly after the revolution. However, the old attitudes still prevail, and, thus, no one expects them to be enforced. This has turned out to be the case because other issues relating to economic policy have received priority in the political system.
There is no politically important environmental movement in the Czech Republic, and the one environmental group that had been active has been classified as an extremist movement and has no support from the general public.
There are no special programmes or subsidies to deal with environmental problems in agriculture in the Czech Republic. However, some payments have been created to maintain the rural landscape, but these are really disguised income transfer payments to persons in depressed rural areas.
In Western Europe it was agreed that there was movement toward a new social contract with widespread support for preserving rural landscape and conserving natural resources. Recently, concerns on these issues have been broadened to issues regarding the naturalness and safety of foods and the welfare of farm animals. Increasingly, there is interest in using these issues to justify the large payments being made under the CAP, or as one person termed it, "Farmers have highjacked the rural environmental movement."
Some argued that it was wrong to have to pay farmers to stop polluting. It was argued that under the principle of 'the polluter pays' environmental damage can be avoided by using regulations rather than paying polluters not to pollute. If the agricultural system is to be sustainable in terms of not damaging the environment, it should bear the cost of avoiding pollution. It was also argued that in Central Europe despite the seeming reluctance to enforce regulations, it would be necessary to enforce them eventually to deal with the pollution problems.
It was argued that farmers may be making a mistake to tie the future of their income transfer payments to protecting the environment. If this relationship is firmly established, it is likely to mean more targeting of payments, both by area and by individuals, which has been strongly resisted under the CAP.
Finally, it was agreed that modem agriculture has two aspects relating to the environment. One aspect is the adverse impact that modem technology and organization has on the environment. The other aspect is that, as owners and managers of a large portion of rural areas, farmers must be involved in efforts to protect the rural landscape and environment. Policies to achieve these two objectives are sometimes confused and mixed.

CHAPTER 8 FROM AGRICULTURAL POLICY TO RURAL POLICY - CENTRAL EUROPE IN TRANSITION
Providing services to agricultural producers and rural people
Providing services to agricultural producers and rural people: Group discussion and a commentary
Providing services to agricultural producers and rural people
by Jerzy Wilkin
The agricultural sector and rural areas in Poland
Agriculture is a very important part of the Polish economy. It contributes approximately seven percent to the GDP and employs 22 percent of labour force. The role of agriculture in Poland is much more important than the structure of the GDP suggests. The situation in agriculture directly affects the standard of living not only of a quarter of the Polish population but also of all other families - through food prices. An average Polish family spends about 35-40 percent of its income on food. The performance of agriculture also significantly affects the rate of inflation, the balance of foreign trade and many other important elements in the Polish economy. Agricultural and food products account for 12 percent of total Polish exports.
Productivity of labour in agriculture is low due to the small average size of farms, shortage of adequate machinery and equipment, relatively poor farmers' education, and inadequate infrastructure and services in rural areas, among other reasons. Most farmers are dually employed, combining agricultural production with work in another area of the economy. In 1994, 2,026 farms of average size (6.7 hectares) existed. The number of farms are projected to decrease to 1,650 in the year 2010.^1 Polish agriculture absorbs relatively more human resources than any other European country (except Russia). The high unemployment rate since 1990 stopped the migration from agriculture and forced some people to return to agricultural activity. In 1994, an agricultural survey indicated a higher number of people worked entirely in agriculture (3,721) than in 1988 (approximately a 13 percent growth rate). This represents an increase of employment per farm from 1.5 workers in 1988 to 1.8 workers
in 1994. Between 1988-1994 the number of dual-occupational farmers declined by 12.7 percent. Since 1990, 444,000 rural family members lost their non-agricultural jobs. Almost half a million people living in farm households seek employment. However, while the rate of unemployment in rural areas is growing, the unemployment rate in urban areas is declining. Under the communist regime (1945-1989), 75 percent of the agricultural land remained in private farms, but the expansion of those farms was restricted due to ideological considerations. Twenty percent of agricultural land was used by state farms, and less than five percent by co-operative farms.

According to the classification used by the Polish Central Statistical Office, rural areas account for 93 percent of the total Polish territory. Rural areas also include lakes, rivers, forests, and so forth. In 1995, 38 percent of Polish population lived in rural areas, with an average population density of 50 people per square kilometre. The highest rural population density is in southern Poland and in regions surrounding big cities.
The typical settlement unit in rural areas is represented by a village with 200-500 inhabitants. Fifteen percent of the rural population lives in small villages with less than 100 inhabitants^2. In 1994, there were 42 thousand villages in Poland administratively grouped in 2157 counties (gminy). The county (gmina) is the basic administrative and self-government unit.

Historical background of the agricultural and rural development in Poland
Between 1795 and 1918, Polish territory was divided among three European powers: Russia, Prussia and Austro-Hungary. The territories under these countries' control underwent different patterns of development, and the part of Poland under the Prussian administration reached the highest level of development while the territory under Russia was very underdeveloped. Agricultural structures, settlement patterns, technical infrastructure and peoples' values and attitudes acquired during the 124 years of domination from different powers had a significant impact on the Polish agriculture and rural areas for following generations. The inter-war period (1918-1939) was too short to allow full integration of areas separated earlier. As a result of the Second World War, Polish borders were shifted to the west causing new integration and adjustment problems. Since the Second World War, one of the principal economic and political goals for the Polish governments has been the exploitation
of the land and other economic resources in the regions that were formerly German.
Most of the state farms were established in western and northern regions of Poland, called 'Regained Lands (Ziemie Odzyskane).'
Agricultural policies of the communist regime (1945-1989) were aimed at fulfilling three principal goals:
∑ To transform private agriculture into a socialist system of agriculture, through collectivisation and nationalisation of land and other productive resources.
∑ To secure sufficient deliveries of cheap agricultural and food products for the rapidly increasing urban population.
∑ To change the traditional character of rural areas and eliminate the great differences in standards of living between urban and rural areas.
Since collectivisation of agriculture failed and the 'forced collectivisation' ended in 1955 with rather meagre results, those goals have never been accomplished. Later attempts at socialisation of agriculture consisted of: a) establishing collective agricultural units to deliver services to private farms; b) expanding the state farm sector; and c) controlling upstream and down-stream industries. Government influenced private farms through indirect forms of control, such as administered prices, a system of rationing agricultural inputs and legal regulations (for example, regulating the size of private farms).
In the late 1970s income parity became another goal of Poland's agricultural policy programmes; that is, farmers should receive a similar level of income as workers in the industrial sector. That goal had to be achieved mainly through agricultural price support policy. In the 1970s and 1980s an income based entirely on agricultural employment reached 80-100 percent of the income outside of agriculture. The goals, income parity for farmers and cheap-food-policy (typical for centrally- planned economies), required high subsidies from the state budget. During the early 1970s, people working on private farms also gained access to publicly financed medical services and pensions.
Peasant farms represented the largest group of private economic activity in the entire Polish economy thus representing an exception among the socialist countries. That fact was proudly emphasised by the farmers themselves; however, this also caused certain illusions regarding the opportunities for the Polish peasant agriculture in the reconstructed market economy. During the round table debates (in March 1989) the private farmers representatives gave their support for the full liberalisation of the Polish economy and were against the far-reaching restriction of state interference into any economic affairs. They were convinced that in the market economy the farmers would manage much better than other occupational groups. Income effects of food price liberalisation, initiated by the Rakowski government in 1989, initially were favourable for farmers, thereby, strengthening their belief in the free market. Disillusionment with the market economy came somewhat later.
Although Polish agriculture had never been collectivised during the 45 years of Socialism, it could not be described as market-oriented. Throughout that period it operated within a centrally-planned economy and was subject to the majority of constraints and distortions inherent in the system. Farmers managed to adjust themselves to the conditions of the socialist economy and to survive under those conditions. However, the methods of dealing with the socialist system developed during that period turned out to be of little use under the changing conditions of the free market economy.
The condition of the Polish peasant farms was determined by the glass jar effect generated by the economic system and policies of the socialist regime. The glass jar had a dual effect on Polish agriculture On the one hand, it provided stable economic conditions for the functioning of agriculture (stable prices, guaranteed sales of farm products, low though predictable level of income, isolation from the world market interference), while on the other hand, it restricted farm expansion opportunities by imposing acreage limits for private farms, rationing of farm inputs and monopolisation of farm product purchases, to name a few.
The socialist state authorities in charge of economic policy controlled private sector agriculture by keeping full control over the agricultural inputs and output. They priced and rationed farm inputs, set prices for farm products and almost completely socialised the purchasing system and agro-processing plants. The authorities, furthermore, imposed the type or form of institution and organization dealing with agriculture and its environment. The economic parameters in agriculture, especially prices, were greatly distorted because they did not reflect market conditions including the scarcity of resources. Until 1990, the Polish farmers lived in an almost dream-like world, their beliefs concerning their economic strength were a great illusion.
Forty-five years of communist rule left farmers with deeply rooted beliefs: a) the state authorities are responsible for keeping agricultural prices at parity levels, b) all products have to be purchased through the procurement system, and c) farmers' well-being, in general terms, depends on the agricultural policy of the government These strong beliefs among farmers were confirmed by the surveys conducted in 1990 and in 1992.

Access to infrastructure in rural areas
Under the communist regime, the technical and social infrastructure in rural areas was totally neglected, thus, the economic and social differences between urban and rural areas were not significantly reduced.
The major progress in the development of technical infrastructure in the 1990s is reflected in the water and gas supply and telephone installations. Water supply is one of the biggest problems in rural areas in Poland since 46 percent of villages still do not have adequate access to water, especially during certain seasons. The water quality in most of the villages is very poor. Forty percent of Polish villages have a water supply system serving the whole village and a quarter of those installations have been built during last five years. There are, however, strong regional differences In the northern and western regions some 70 percent of the villages have water supply systems compared to only 30 percent of the villages in the eastern and southern parts of Poland. The progress made in water installations is not accompanied by progress in building sewage treatment installations. Only two percent of villages are equipped with such installations, which leads to many
environmental problems in rural areas. To improve the situation, public institutions financially supporting rural water supply projects make that support contingent upon the simultaneous installation of sewage treatment facilities in the same village.
The small size of many villages and the insufficient investments in infrastructure in the past make access to basic services for rural people difficult. Most villages lack services, forcing their inhabitants to travel to meet the needs of everyday life. (See Table 2.)

The availability of services in the past six years has deteriorated because of the sharp reduction in public transportation services in rural areas. Due to financial problems many bus lines and railroads either have ceased to exist or have reduced the number of buses and trains servicing certain areas. Although an increasing number of rural households have a vehicle, still more than 60 percent of the households are without automobiles.
Public and private transportation in some rural areas is hindered by the poor road conditions. Only 35 percent of local roads (maintained by gminy^3) have hard surfaces. Gminy have serious financial difficulties keeping the paved and unpaved roads in good condition. According to the latest survey, only one percent of local roads are repaired on a regular basis. Poor condition of local roads (seasonally or all year) makes it very difficult for 20 percent of farmers to reach their farms.
^3 In Poland a gmina (pl , gminy) is the smallest territorial subdivision exercising administrate functions.
All villages have access to electricity, but the quality and the reliability of the electric systems in rural areas is rather unsatisfactory. In the period 1990-1995, there was almost total stagnation in the maintenance and modernisation of electricity supply systems. Most villages suffer periodically from an interruption in the supply of electricity. In some areas farmers have no access to high voltage electricity (380 V), which limits the use of many types of farm machinery and equipment. The high installation cost of alternative sources of energy (hydropower, windmills and biogas) prohibits their use. Electrical reconstruction and modernisation in rural areas is one of the most important prerequisites to rural development and business investment in those areas.
The quality of life in rural areas also depends on the social infrastructure which is needed to provide health care services, education, recreation and cultural activities. Statistics indicate access to health, education, cultural and recreational services is much lower in rural areas when contrasted with urban areas. (See Table 3.) These conditions are perpetuated by the neglected social infrastructure and lower incomes in rural areas. The gap between the standard of living of an average urban and rural family is the widest when comparing the health, education, culture and recreation services. The availability of infrastructure in rural and urban areas plays a decisive role in the differences shown in Table 3 The gap is smaller in housing and consumption of durable goods, and the food consumption patterns are almost the same.

Access to public services in rural areas did not improve with the 1990 reforms in administrative structures and methods of financing in the public sector (including social infrastructure), in fact, access deteriorated Now most of the educational, cultural and a number of the health care institutions are administered and financed by the local (gmina) authorities The results of these reforms are mixed On the positive side, the efficiency of public spending on infrastructure and services has increased and local communities have become involved in decision making related to their local affairs The people's involvement with local decision making also has been linked to the democratisation processes introduced in Poland after 1989 On the less positive side, a great number of poorer gminy do not have access to resources needed for the maintenance and the development of social and technical infrastructure During the period 1990-95, this situation caused a sharp decline in the
availability of basic public services It has been counterbalanced only partially by the increased number of services financed from private sources (for example, the development of private schools and clinics). The result is increasing and observable regional differences in standard of living, access to public services, to infrastructures and to public safety. These regional differences are in conflict with the prevailing and deeply rooted values and beliefs of Polish society.
Values and beliefs of Polish farmers at the beginning of the systemic transformation period
The state of mind of the average farmer at the beginning of the 1990s was very disturbing It was a mixture of pessimism, dissatisfaction, substantial passivity (psychologically supported by reliance on state assistance) and a sense of helplessness As revealed by Centre for Public Opinion Polling (CBOS) surveys presented in the book Rolnicy '92^4 as many as 93 percent of farmers saw the situation of Polish agriculture as bad and very bad, and only nine percent believed that the situation would improve within the year Polish farmers did not embrace capitalism (only 20 percent considered it a desirable system), but they had an even less favourable opinion about socialism (only six percent supported it). Fifty-one percent of the interviewed farmers declared themselves in favour of the third path. Perhaps this was the longing for 'capitalism with a human face.' The majority of farmers fear the mechanism of the capitalist economy. Only 34 percent believe that such a system
provides opportunities for agricultural development, while 43 percent of farmers have a totally opposite opinion.

The Polish farmers have a deeply rooted conviction that the state should have a very active role in agriculture. As many as 86 percent of farmers believe that the state should guarantee purchases of all farmers' products, and 74 percent of them declared that in the market economy agriculture should be privileged. Farmers, however still, were critical of the role of the government in relation to rural and agricultural issues. Only 16 percent of respondents believed that the activities of the government benefited the Polish rural and agricultural sector. They had a somewhat better opinion about the activities of the Minister of Agriculture (30 percent of positive opinions).
The selected results of surveys concerning the beliefs and attitudes of Polish farmers presented here perhaps do not reflect accurately the state of mind of the farmers, though the actual situation probably does not differ much from the picture just presented. The most important conclusion to draw from the information presented in these surveys is that farmers need to learn, understand and adopt a market mentality. This means they must: a) understand how the market functions; b) understand risk and how to manage it; c) cultivate innovative attitudes; d) learn to manage both rationally and efficiently; e) learn to adapt quickly to changing market conditions; and f) develop the ability to see change as an emerging opportunity. The second important and related conclusion is that farmers need appropriate institutions to help them adjust to the market economy.
It is difficult to identify and classify the values and beliefs underlying agricultural policies in Poland after 1989. At least in the first two years of the transformation period agricultural policy was subordinated to other goals and values expressed in the Balcerowicz Plan^5.

Total economic liberalisation was considered the most effective tool to cure the economic disorder inherited from the communist period. The primary goal was macroeconomic stabilisation and most importantly the reduction of inflation which reached 600 percent in 1990. In order to stabilise the economy and enhance the competitiveness of Polish industry, the new government sought an open economy through price liberalisation, a break-up of the foreign trade monopoly and free access to the production sector.
In the early 1990s, because of a number of adverse macroeconomic conditions, particularly a decline in real incomes and a lower demand for consumer goods, there was an overproduction of agricultural and food products. The government, however, found it difficult to introduce programmes which would favour agriculture and farmers as a group. First, farmers were less likely to become unemployed while unemployment was a growing social and economic problem in Poland. Second, compared to the rest of the economy, the rate of price increases for agricultural goods was increasing at a slower rate and agricultural incomes were declining more slowly than in other economic sectors. Agriculture was considered a positive factor in Poland's anti-inflation programme.
The Polish farmers, meanwhile, were dissatisfied and disillusioned with the early results of the economic reforms. They pressured the authorities to introduce protective policies. Unfair competition from abroad became an important argument in the farmers arsenal. In response some broad protections related to agricultural trade were introduced.
The Agricultural Market Agency was one of the first agriculturally-focused institutions established after 1990. The Agency's mandate was market interventions aimed at the stabilisation of prices - which at that time meant a reduction of price fluctuation for the basic agricultural products. In post-communist Poland reducing price volatility for agricultural and food products was a comer-stone of agricultural policy.
One of the most powerful, although not sufficiently recognised, factors behind the shaping of agricultural policy in Poland, and in many other post-communist countries, is the demonstration effect. Basically, this means many farmers' groups and politicians cited the West European experience as the policy prototype to follow. This approach became increasingly important as the integration of the Polish economy into the economic system of the European Community became the focus. The farmers and their allies called for the introduction of 'CAP-like policies' in Poland to protect farmers from what they believed was the unfair competition of the heavily subsidised West European agriculture. The introduction of CAP-like policies in post-communist countries has been hampered by a lack of financial resources and the growing criticism of the CAP within the European Community.
Concerns about unfair competition in food and agriculture is often linked with the effectiveness of agriculture. Many agricultural policy decision-makers look to the modernisation paradigm as a method of addressing these concerns. Policy makers cite the need for an active structural policy to change rapidly the backward agrarian structure of Polish agriculture. They see moderation fostering a shift from peasant farming to modem commercial agriculture.
Modernisation is an important value for rural policy which is in statu nascendi in Poland. The agricultural modernisation is impossible without modernisation of the rural areas. Rural modernisation embraces a great number of issues, such as, access of rural people to education, welfare, health services, information and culture. Disparities in the availability of these services or elements, which to a great degree comprise quality of life, are considered a barrier to the development of rural areas, modernisation of agriculture, not to mention the fulfilment of the social justice criterion.
In terms of Polish rural policy, two new values are gaining attention and significance: a) full employment for rural people; and b) protection of natural and cultural environment. The problem of unemployment, especially high in rural areas, is becoming the key element of the newly emerging rural policy in Poland.

Institutional and organizational weaknesses of agriculture and agribusiness in Poland
The structure of agribusiness in Poland is regarded as relatively backward and distorted. Both down-stream and up-stream sectors of agribusiness are insufficiently developed. The greatest proportion of gross production of the entire agribusiness sector still originates in agriculture.
The rather low productivity of agriculture is partly caused by the weak support received from other sectors of agribusiness. Before 1990, most of the down-stream and up-stream industries were controlled by the state and cooperative organizations while agriculture was privately owned for the most part. A significant part of agricultural production was not processed and was channelled directly from farmers to consumers.
The systemic reforms introduced under the Balcerowicz Plan, in the beginning of 1990, accelerated transformation of agribusiness sectors, especially through the privatisation of the food processing industry and trade (both wholesale and retail). In 1996, almost 100 percent of food trade was handled by the private sector and 60 percent of the food processing was privatised. The collapse of many co-operative and state institutions serving agriculture represented an additional problem for the development of the agricultural sector. In the period between 1945-1989, most of the institutions providing agricultural services, trade, banking and procurement were of the co-operatives and were consequently controlled by the central or local state authorities. The farmers' influence on the activities of rural co-operatives was rather limited. This situation contributed to farmers' distrust of any form of co-operative organization suitable to fulfil the needs of farmers and the rural
population. Most of the co-operatives have been in deep crises since the 1990s. In Poland and other post-communist countries, there has been a 'marginalisation' of the role of cooperatives in agriculture and in the economy as a whole.^6 A 1993 survey showed that in Poland over two thousand co-operatives collapsed since 1988, and many of those have not been replaced by other, more effective, forms of organization serving rural people.

There are no intermediary institutions between the state and the farms and-this fact created an institutional vacuum. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Polish farmers rely heavily on state support, assistance and protection. Over the last four decades, they have come to believe whatever actions were taken in agriculture or in the economy were directly, or indirectly, dependent on the state's activities. In Poland, the various possible types of institutions which usually offer support to private farmers have not been formed and the ones that exist operate very poorly. In Western Europe farmers receive support from a great number of co-operatives and other organizations set up, controlled and protected by the farmers themselves: co-operatives, agricultural chambers, producers' organizations, processing companies, agricultural extension and marketing institutions. Furthermore, there is also an extension service system offering farmers production, economic and social
advice. There are, in addition, stable forms of production relationships between agriculture, agro-processing and marketing of agricultural products. Additionally, there are state institutions that support agriculture.
In Poland, most of the relationships between the farmer and his environment formed during the period of state socialism have been dismantled. At the same time, many organizations from the previous economic and political system have disintegrated. This vacuum has not been filled by new farmers' associations or organizations, that would strengthen their position and enable them to profit from agricultural processing, marketing and international trade. However, the process of creating a new institutional structure of state support and protection for agriculture is close to being completed. The new structure includes the Agricultural Market Agency, the Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture, and the Agency for Agricultural Property of the State Treasury. The farmers, however, have been slow to establish their own support institutions. To date, there are no tangible results. This, again, confirms the weakness of the Polish farmers, including their elites.
The efforts and initiatives in establishing new links between the farmers' community and other components of the agricultural sector, such as the processing plants, companies supplying farm inputs and marketing agricultural products, are still very inefficient. Farmers fail to understand that in order to adjust to European Union conditions, they will have to develop modern patterns of cooperation with the Polish food and agriculture sector.
The transition to the market economy has made it very difficult for the majority of farmers to find effective marketing channels and methods of selling their products. Under the socialist system such problems did not exist because in an economy permanently afflicted by shortages, all products could be sold relatively easily. The socialist extension service was targeted entirely toward increasing agricultural production and the expansion of 'the socialist production relations.' In a market economy, new knowledge and new institutions are needed for farmers to survive and to progress. These must include the financial institutions serving farmers and food producers. At the onset of the transformation period, farms and food processing plants were serviced by 1600 co-operative banks subordinated to the Bank for Food Economy (Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej - BGZ) which was partly owned by the state and partly by the co-operatives. The co-operative banks, operated on the same basis as
the state banks and they were used by the communist government as a tool for manipulating the food and agricultural sector.
In 1994, BGZ became a joint stock company. Current plans are to establish nine regional banks encompassing 1,200 co-operative rural banks. By the end of 1995, the Central Bank of Poland licensed five regional banks, only two actually have started operating. The financial situation of the entire rural banking system, and particularly the BGZ, was very poor, mainly because of the inadequate evaluation and monitoring procedures which allowed high-risk investors to receive loans. Most of the debtors were state-owned farms and food processing plants. To rescue the rural banking system, especially the BGZ from financial crisis, the government issued debt restructuring bonds worth ZL 17 trillion (about US$ 800 million). The debt rescheduling arrangements for the BGZ were criticised severely by both the opposition and the media.
Restructuring the rural banking system and making adjustments to a market economy is important if Polish agriculture and the food economy are to expand and prosper. Bank restructuring required government support since the rural bank crisis was caused, at least partially, by the agricultural policies of the former government which granted support to state farms and big food processing plants. The recovery of the rural banking system also is crucial for the effective distribution of subsidised credits to farmers and food producers. Since 1994, subsidised credits have become the most important government tool used to support agriculture.
The average Polish farmer is poorly equipped to face the competition in European or world markets. The farmers' means of production (land, machinery and equipment) are scarce and inadequate. Farmers have little knowledge about market behaviour and marketing mechanisms. Nor do they have the institutions that could support their efforts and strengthen their position in this area. Farmers are also disillusioned, disheartened and have no faith in the future. Some of this may improve relatively soon, but not without a struggle. Some farmers may require much longer to change. The situation in Polish agriculture is extremely complex, much more complex than can be presented here in brief. One thing is certain, the major problems involved in transforming Polish agriculture have yet to be faced.
From agricultural policy to rural policy: a shift in paradigms and goals
The political and economic revolution taking place in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989 has presented a challenge to agricultural and rural policies. The revolution coincides with a shift in agricultural policy patterns and goals of the European Community and in some other industrialised countries. A good example of the need for radical change of major paradigms of rural development is proposed in the Council of Europe document, entitled European Charter for Rural Areas.^7 The reforms initiated in the EC by McSharry in 1992 lead in the same direction.
^7 European Charter for Rural Areas. Preliminary Draft Report, 1995. Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Council of Europe.
Since 1989, Polish agricultural policy has gone through three stages:
Stage I: From the end of 1989 to mid-1991, was characterised by several fundamental reforms:
∑ Price liberalisation.
∑ Breaking up of trade monopolies (both domestic and foreign).
∑ Opening up of the national economy.
∑ Removal of state subsidies for agricultural and food products.
∑ Lack of clear sectoral policies (including agricultural), and the subordination of all governmental policies to the realisation of the principal macroeconomic goals (principally the reduction of the inflation rate, and the accomplishment of other macro stabilisation programmes).
∑ Disintegration of the state farm sector.
∑ Breaking up of the existing monopolies, by breaking down some big public companies and by lifting barriers on competitive imports.
∑ Liberalisation of the land market and abolition of size limits for private farms.
As the result of those measures agriculture and other sectors of the economy became exposed to foreign competition. The state reduced its support to agricultural producers and protection of the agro-food sector to almost zero. This stage is commonly called the 'shock therapy' period of the post-communist transition. At the time, agricultural policy was almost non-existent. Mr. Leszek Balcerowicz, the main architect of the shock therapy reforms, strongly opposed government policies directed towards a particular sector of the economy (including agriculture). He accepted only limited macroeconomic policies, some forms of social policy and the most necessary systemic reforms. During this period, the Producer Subsidy Equivalent (PSE) fell from 23 percent in 1988 to minus 18 percent in 1990.^8

Stage II: From mid-1991 to 1994. The main features of the stage were the following:
∑ Introduction of several protectionist measures (high tariffs, import levies and non-tariff barriers).
∑ Establishment of major institutions responsible for government policy in agriculture (Agricultural Market Agency, Agricultural Property Agency of the State Treasury, Agency for Modernisation and Restructuring of Agriculture).
∑ Signing the Association Agreement with the European Communities and the introduction of programmes aimed at the adjustment of the Polish economy (including agriculture) to the conditions in the European Union.
∑ The support for agriculture (excluding the welfare programmes) declined from 3.7 percent of the state budget in 1991 to 2.5 percent of the total state budget in 1994.
∑ Government had continued indirect subsidies in supporting the agricultural progress (subsidies to qualified seed, extension service, soil conservation, melioration, liming, etc.).
∑ No direct payments to farmers, production subsidies or export subsidies were introduced.
∑ Producer Subsidy Equivalent in agricultural production increased to 15 percent, mostly due to protectionist measures introduced in 1991-1992.
Stage III: From 1994 onwards:
Agricultural policy has been linked to the completion of the government's four-year Strategy for Poland programme, prepared by the team headed by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Mr. Grzegorz Kolodko. In 1994, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Economy published the document Principles of socio-economic policies for rural areas, agriculture and food economy up to year 2000^9. Both of these documents incorporated agriculture into a broader policy aimed at the development of rural areas.

For Poland, the shift from agricultural policy to rural policy is a positive phenomenon because:
∑ Most of the problems faced by 'the rural people in Poland can be solved only by much broader socio-economic policies which deal with various aspects of rural life, and more specifically policies geared towards:
* Improvement of social and technical infrastructure.
* Creation of employment in the non-agricultural sectors.
* Protection of the natural environment.
* Introduction of housing projects suitable for the nature of rural areas.
* Protection of the cultural heritage of rural areas.
∑ The present structure of Polish population and the projected demographic trends show that the rural population will grow, while the agricultural population will decrease. The creation of new non-agricultural job opportunities in rural areas, therefore, becomes imperative. According to recent studies, 75 percent of Polish farms have no potential to become viable, efficient productive units, able to survive under competitive market conditions.^10 For the majority of these farms, pension or some other form of non-agricultural income is the main source of their income. In 1995, over two million people were receiving agricultural pensions (from Agricultural Social Insurance Fund - KRUS) almost equal to the number of farms in Poland.
^10 Wos, A Tendencje rozwoju rolnictwa w warunkach rynkowych. Warszawa: Szkola Glowna Handlow, 1994
∑ The majority of the non-agricultural population more strongly supports government programmes which will provide basic services (i.e., health care, education, transportation or public safety) for people living in rural areas, than they support programmes that help agricultural producers (especially in the form of price and income support).
∑ Thanks to an increased number of personal cars, easier and more flexible transportation facilities, rural areas are becoming an attractive location (cheaper land, clean environment, safer, etc.) for the new housing developments and for recreational purposes. The principle barriers to faster expansion of the rural areas remain, however, the poor conditions of technical and social infrastructure in rural areas - the legacy of the former economic system.
∑ In Poland, as in many Western European countries, attitudes toward rural areas are changing. These areas are treated now as a commonwealth for the nation to be appreciated and protected from degradation. Some values linked to a rural lifestyle, e.g., natural and cultural diversity, traditional family life, community identity and safety, are becoming popular and widely accepted. This also represents a reaction to the previously socialist industrialisation ideology and primitive urbanisation.
∑ The development of some theoretical concepts like: a) sustainable agriculture and development; b) multi-functional agriculture and multi-functional rural areas; c) ecological sustain-ability; and d) new theories of economic development, to name a few,^11 also support a shift from agricultural policy to rural policy, including environmental and social infrastructure issues.

In the post-communist countries where all elements of the political, social and economic systems are changing, the search for new agricultural and rural policies is of paramount importance. The implementation of new policies also represents a unique opportunity to avoid some of the mistakes made by the industrialised Western economies.

Providing services to agricultural producers and rural people: Group discussion and a commentary
by Frances Sandiford-Rossmiller
Rural policy in Britain is conditioned by a very different agricultural and rural situation from that in Central and Eastern Europe, and also from that in many Western European countries. Only 1.2 percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, compared with 2.3-2.5 percent some twenty years ago. There are 172,000 agricultural holdings, of which only 89,000 are classified as being full-time. So the rural scene is very much non-agricultural, in contrast to the rural scenery which is wholly agricultural. The pattern of living in the rural areas has changed drastically over the last twenty years. While the total population has increased by about 3.5 percent, the corresponding figure for the rural population is 17 percent so there has been (and still is) a substantial urban exodus. Were it not for the strict planning controls (see Chapter Seven) that prevent uncontrolled development, the rural areas would be home to a suburban-style sprawl.
What do these new rural dwellers do? Well, the pattern of employment has changed drastically. Big-city centres have been losing jobs and their 'white collar' populations as government offices, commercial firms and light industry relocate to the suburbs, smaller towns or rural areas, perhaps as a result of deliberate policies for regional development, or because of the decline of the old heavy industries, or to provide a more attractive working environment. Government statistics indicate that the pattern of employment in the rural areas, both 'remote rural' and 'accessible rural', differs very little from urban metropolitan areas in the country as a whole (although the figures do, of course, mask substantial local variation, and Scotland and Wales have greater divergences). In combination with relatively good transport infrastructure and widespread car ownership, and inner-city decay, these changes have encouraged the growth of commuting from places formerly considered too
remote. But commuting is not always necessary for those who wish to live in the countryside. There are now more employment opportunities in the rural areas for semi-skilled and skilled workers, and the self-employed: the new business start-up rate is higher in rural areas than in the towns, and the communications revolution has led to the creation of jobs such as tele-working. The rural population has also been boosted by an inflow of retired people, and the growth of second-home ownership with weekend-only occupation, which may not be very large in total but has a tremendous impact in certain areas.
We can with equal justification ask what the old rural dwellers are doing, if getting on towards half of the agricultural holdings are part-time. Well, there are two distinct trends in the activities of the agricultural population. One is farm diversification, which refers to the use of agricultural resources for non-farming purposes. Examples include 'horsy-culture', farm shops, woodland management, countryside sports (e.g., hunting, shooting and fishing), and agro-tourism. The second is pluri-activity, which refers to income-generating activities that are not farm-based, such as factory, shop or office work.
Such changes in population and employment have led the Government to ask the question, "What now makes a rural area rural?" Since it clearly is no longer the predominance of farming, and it isn't a structural difference in employment patterns, then what is it? And really it has come down to a truism: rural areas are rural by virtue of the fact that they are greener than non-rural areas. This has made the formulation of a rural policy rather difficult, which is reflected in the existence of separate rural policy white papers for England, Scotland and Wales (the discussion in this section is based on that for England). It also has substantial implications for the values and beliefs that underpin and drive rural policy, and explains the very strong 'environmental amenity' approach to rural policy, which is based on a consumerist approach to the rural environment. Rural policy cannot be separated from environmental policy. I shall not repeat here the discussion about the rural
myth in 'Revealed Beliefs and Values' in Chapter 7, my chapter on the English experience of protecting the rural environment: but it is equally valid in this context of specifically rural policies, and explains the conflicts between the traditional, agriculture-based rural population and the new rural population.
The degree to which the traditional agricultural community is being put under pressure by the working out of beliefs and values that are not rural in origin may be seen at its most extreme in England, but most countries in Western Europe are experiencing a variety of pressures on the traditional rural way of life. Very different understandings of the nature of rurality are found between, and sometimes within, each country. One thing that all have in common is a decreasing proportion of the population that is directly dependent on agriculture for a livelihood. In some places this is causing severe rural depopulation, high levels of rural unemployment, and an associated loss of rural commercial and social facilities. In other places new opportunities have prevented or reversed economic depression, but the demands for rural facilities may be quite different, as may the ability to supply them. Either way, the nature of rural life has changed. With agriculture declining in
importance, agricultural policy cannot carry the full weight of rural development, and so we see in Western Europe a new importance being attached to rural policy. But whereas there has been a fairly general consensus about the objectives of agricultural policy, I should not expect to see a similar consensus about those of rural policy.
This may well cause tension within the EU over the next few years. As noted in Chapter 2, since 1988, the promotion of rural development has been included in the objectives of regional policy (the '5b objectives'). Attempts by agricultural interests, primarily in the richer EU countries where most of the agricultural support ends up, to hijack regional aid (structural funds) in order to ease the pain of CAP reform are likely to meet with strong opposition from the poorer, i.e., net recipient, EU countries who have most to gain from the structural funds.^12 These tensions are not likely to be lessened by the access negotiations with the CEE countries, who, by and large, are more concerned with the problems of rural development as a whole, including the provision of services to all rural inhabitants, than with the narrower issue of supporting agriculture.
^12 In the April following this workshop, a three-day conference was held in Brussels (the European Cohesion Forum) to debate the future of regional aid. The Financial Times of 28 April 1997 reported that the EU commissioner for regional policy will "reject calls for a big increase in aid to rural areas aimed at cushioning farmers against the coming shake-up in the Common Agricultural Policy." The regional commissioner said that "the CAP has not helped economic and social cohesion in the EU: most of the aid went to farmers in rich countries... rather than poorer countries." The proposals had been put forward by the EU commissioner for agriculture who "wanted to direct EU regional aid to help farming communities cope with reductions in subsidies," and had previously "pressed the idea of amalgamating the regional and CAP funds, which together comprise more than two-thirds of the total EU budget."

CHAPTER 9 CONSUMER INTERESTS IN THE AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL SECTOR
Consumers and the agro-food sector (Czech Republic)
Consumers and the agro-food sector: A commentary
Group discussion on "Consumers and the agro-food sector"
Consumers and the agro-food sector (Czech Republic)
by Tomas Doucha
This paper discusses the attitudes of Czech consumers toward Czech agro-food products and the role of the government in the agro-food sector during: a) the period before reform, ending in 1989; b) the reform period, 1989-1995; and c) the future. The study examines food safety and food security in agro-food production; as well as, the public goods produced by agriculture and the compensation agro-food producers receive or should receive from the society for those goods. Each area is analysed through the interaction of the three market partners: a) consumers with their beliefs and expectations; b) producers and their responses to market conditions and consumers' demand; and c) the government which is responsible for creating basic market incentives and regulations.
Food safety, food security and public goods
Food safety is a complex expression of certain components of food quality that are related to consumer health, particularly hygienic standards and nutritional value that directly affect consumers' health (or malnutrition). In the broadest definition, food safety encompasses methods of production, storage, sale and use of a given product.
Food security can be defined as the ability of a society over time to provide a constant and sufficient quantity of food products at adequate prices to satisfy needs of all social groups. In a narrower sense, food security can mean the ability of a country to provide food for its population even under the most adverse world market developments. In this connection we can speak about a 'food security threshold.' This threshold can be defined as a quantity of scarce and long-term durable resources that must be used permanently and/or preserved by the state in order to ensure a constant share of domestic demand will be met with domestic supply.
Public goods, much more than food safety or food security, have an important characteristic related to the concept of externalities and their possible internalisation. Both producers and more generally rural people (the 'producers of villages and rural traditions') are at the same time consumers of these public goods.
It should be pointed out that in the Czech Republic, research and studies regarding the consumers' behaviour and the food market are at the earliest stage of development. Due to the lack of reliable data this analysis is primarily based on personal experience and opinions supported by some special surveys and the limited statistics available.
Consumers and food safety
Under the socialist system the distribution of consumer goods, including food-stuffs, was mediated through the market. In spite of many market distortions consumers were able to decide on which goods to spend their money, and when and where to purchase them. Because of a combination of market imperfections, e.g., limited competition of food supplies from imports, insufficient public information regarding food quality and safety, pressure exerted through normal channels, i.e., consumer pressure, or competition between producers and retailers, did not force food security issues onto the 'daily policy agenda.' As contacts with developed countries gradually expanded, information about different aspects of food safety started to penetrate Czech society. The state was forced, though with delay, to introduce food safety legislation and to establish institutions to implement it. It should be noted that many of the new standards were at a much higher level than those applied in
Western countries. Even though the processing and marketing sector in state monopolies found many loopholes to bypass the regulations, a vast majority of consumers believed that the state provided adequate citizen protections that certain foods were healthful.
During the reform period the perception of food safety was influenced by several specific factors. At the beginning of the reform period, the Czech population continued to rely completely on the state for food safety assurances. According to various surveys, consumers' general satisfaction with the quality of food products was increasing.
In the first phase of the reform, a great number of consumers purchased foreign products because of the products' attractive appearance and the quality of the food packaging. The issue of food safety was marginal. Behind these preferences was a naive belief that food products imported from developed countries were automatically top quality and thus healthy. This perception disappeared after two or three years as the Czechs found the quality of foreign products varied significantly.
The more radical phase of the economic reform caused a shift in the public perception of local food products. Since these reforms brought a dramatic drop in real income and an increase in income disparities for the majority of consumers, the price of food became the most important criterion for consumers purchasing food products. Gradually, along with food prices, the quality of domestic raw materials also became a significant criterion. The new rich strata of Czech society, however, which had gained wealth quickly and easily, continued to purchase luxury foreign food products without considering food safety.
During the early years of reform when the quality of food generally deteriorated, the Czech consumer reacted with greater passivity. Many consumers continued to rely on state institutions and the information provided by the official mass media and several special private periodicals. For example, even after the state food standards and norms were abolished in 1995, many food processors continue to label their products as being in accord with state standards with the expectation that these labelled foods would gain the consumers confidence. Their expectations appeared to be correct. As consumers continued to purchased these labelled products, they demonstrated their 'hidden' need for and confidence in the state certification. Because of these and other conditions accompanying reform, consumers were not able to establish associations to lobby or pressure effectively the government, Parliament, producers and distributors about agro-food issues of concern to them.
Nutritionally speaking, the consumers preferred attractively presented food products more than healthful products. The latest surveys, however, show a positive shift toward a more health-conscience diet with growing consumption of fruit and vegetables and declining consumption of animal fats.
Considering the continuing high share of the household budget currently devoted to food, it is not reasonable to expect that an average Czech consumer would be willing to pay more for a higher level of food safety. As Czech society establishes a middle class, the previously passive attitudes of Czech consumers toward food safety and good nutrition, are likely to be replaced with more proactive attitudes. A society with a real middle class, with higher income and educational potential, is more likely to give a high priority to food safety and to demand such assurances from government. Given these changing conditions it is reasonable to expect that in the near future, the demands of the Czech consumers for food safety will gradually increase and will approach Western standards. At the same time, the Czech consumers are likely to become more sensitive to farming and processing methods, especially the use of pesticides and additives. In these areas they are likely to press for
stronger state regulations concerning production methods and marketing practices.
The development of food safety - responses of producers and distributors
State monitoring and control institutions have obtained data that show food quality according to hygienic and technical standards has deteriorated significantly during the reform period, especially between 1989 and 1993. For example, in the marketing of food, foods marked to sell by a certain date that ensure freshness had been sold after that date. In the food processing industry hygienic standards were disregarded while technological methods of ensuring hygienic processing were not followed. This situation is obviously the result of the property restitution and privatisation process which facilitated the start-up of a large number of new private producers and retailers.
The low efficiency of sanctions imposed by the state only facilitates this disregard for the standards. The situation is particularly critical with the small-scale producers such as bakers, confectioners, meat processors, delicatessens and restaurants. The quality of agricultural products, particularly potatoes, has also deteriorated, especially because of the high use of nitrates. However, a considerably higher level of nitrates and other contaminants has been recorded in imported products such as tropical fruits, coffee and tea.
The decreased use of contaminants in the food chain recorded during the reform period could be explained largely by the scarce financial resources of farm producers. The use of variable inputs such as fertilisers and pesticides dropped by 70 percent in comparison with the use of inputs during the period before reform. Nevertheless, the quality of surface water continued to deteriorate mainly because of the contamination caused by livestock sheds and by unsuitable storage of fuel on farms.
The main factors influencing further deterioration of the Czech agricultural and food industry products are: a) domestic and foreign competition; and, to some extent, b) the high demands coming from Western tourists. Some of the largest food enterprises are foreign-owned and apply their own quality management systems. However, the number of such enterprises is still very small.
The role of the state in providing food safety
Food safety was one of the priority goals of state policy even during the period before reform. The centrally controlled economy introduced a very intricate system of obligatory technical standards aimed at safeguarding both product quality and food safety. However, one of the main characteristics of the system prior to the reform period was the extreme reluctance of the state to inform consumers when there were lapses in food safety in the food chain.
At the beginning of the reform period, food safety continued to be an important state goal but the instruments and methods used to achieve it were those of the old regime. The improvement of food quality became one of the main long-term goals of agricultural policy, supported by legislative, institutional and other measures. The present legislation is a chaotic mixture of the laws in place prior to the reform period and laws enacted during reform including:
∑ The Consumers Law (1992).
∑ The People's Health Protection Law (1966).
∑ The Certification Law (1968).
∑ The Technical Standards Law (1992).
∑ The Veterinary Law (1987).
In 1995, obligatory technical standards were abolished, except for standards related to some fruits, vegetables and a few other products. The government now is proposing new revisions to the Food Law.
The food safety legislation and controls are implemented through various institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Health. For example, until 1993, in many localities there were frequent cases of cattle contamination with polychlorbiphenyls (PCB) and the state compensated farmers for the liquidation of contaminated farms, herds and animals. The specific measures that guarantee support to farmers in the case of emergencies such as animal/plant health catastrophes are considered part of agricultural policy.
Although, as a whole, the present control of the food safety can be considered satisfactory, there are still some obstacles that decrease the efficiency of state control, e.g., overlapping jurisdictions of various state institutions and the inadequate technical equipment. Nevertheless, the state has an optimistic outlook regarding food safety.
In the near future the state will be confronted with new tasks and will have to find rapid solutions to many serious problems. The predicted growth of demand, both domestic and foreign, will require the state to find quick solutions especially to satisfy the demands of the EU consumers in -compliance with the White Book^1. If the Czech Republic wants to join the EU single market, these demands represent a serious challenge for the Czech agro-food sector. The White Book demands will not be met without further modifications in Czech legislation, as well as substantial improvements in the state administration and private investments in new agricultural and food industry technologies.
^1 The White Book is a list of the EU legislation linked with food safety and environmental demands on the agro-food sector from the side of consumers, as a part of acquis communautaire. It was published by the EU and distributed to the associated countries in 1995.
The state reaction to the new challenges and problems is expressed in the recently prepared Food Law^2, presented by the government in 1995, but not yet accepted by the Parliament. Until 1995, food-stuffs were regulated under a system of obligatory certifications and some specific technical standards. The new system, expected to be enforced by the new Food Law, includes:
^2 The Food Law was accepted by the Parliament in 1997.
∑ The abolition of the obligatory certification for foods, with the exception of foods destined to certain groups of citizens (children, diabetics, etc.).
∑ The abolition of all obligatory technical standards.
∑ The creation of new standards worked out in conjunction with the relevant companies.
∑ The obligatory implementation of the Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) systems in processing firms.
∑ The obligatory labelling providing information on food composition (including additives) and the possibility of International Standard Organization (ISO) certification, obtainable through authorised private certification firms.
If Czech consumers, public administrators and entrepreneurs are prepared to accept the transfer of food safety responsibilities to market actors who act as self-regulators while severely limiting the role of the state, there is a rather serious problem. Considering the consumers' weak position, inadequate technological discipline and the morals and ethics of the new Czech entrepreneurs, this shift represents a high risk for consumers.
Understanding the development of food security
During the period preceding reform state policy was oriented toward a policy of full self-sufficiency and cheap food. The prices of food were fully controlled by the state and were highly subsidised by the negative turnover tax. The consequences for the consumers were, on the one hand, the feeling that there was total food security, and on the other hand, the reality that food was wasted.
With the beginning of the reform period in 1990, the food price subsidies were abolished. In 1991, price liberalisation resulted in rapid price increases thus causing consumption shock, which consequently brought a rapid and substantial decline in food consumption. Food consumption levels gradually recovered after 1992 due to a gradual growth in real income.
In the period before reform, major income differentials within the population were almost unknown. Now that a small portion of the population has become rich, there is an increase in the demand for high quality foods and for foods with higher value added.
Food security is linked also to affordable food prices for all consumers. Until 1994, the development of food prices showed a smaller increase than prices for other goods and services. An average consumer was not concerned about food prices at all, not even after the price increases in 1991. However, since 1995, the relationships have been changing, and food prices have become an inflation factor. On average, household expenditures on food (including beverages) have reached nearly one-third of total household expenditures. The level of food prices has become a very sensitive political problem. In the near future the households of young families and pensioners, whose food expenditures presently amount to 40-50 percent of their total expenditures, may become extremely anxious about food security.
Meanwhile, consumers still have not formed consumers' associations. Their interests are protected indirectly by the trade unions, e.g., the commodity boards and the 'tripartite' system linking the government, entrepreneurs and employees.
The Czech Republic has sufficient agricultural capacity to meet fully the domestic demand for food products. If food security is the ability of the state to provide a sufficient amount of food even under extremely unfavourable external conditions, the Czech Republic appears to satisfy the standard in the long-term. Furthermore, the public perception is that there is no real problem in this area.
Nevertheless, there are a few factors that can influence food security. There is the ageing of the Czech population (A growing proportion of the population is retired) and the further increase in the inequalities of income distribution within the Czech society.
The role of the state in the provision of food security
The state so far has not been forced to pay significant attention to food security issues, even though past agricultural programmes have cited food security as a political goal ("sufficient supply of foods at adequate prices").
In the period before reform, the state used centrally-controlled instruments to assure food security. Also, during the reform period the state intervened to address temporary food security problems. For example, after the price liberalisation in 1991, the state, on a temporary basis, set the maximum upper price level for staple foods in the retail market. Export limits were established in 1995 and 1996, after the severe increase of cereal prices on the world market. The state created physical food reserves for food security. The State Market Regulation Fund is designed to stabilise agricultural markets, although its function in this regard is rather problematic.
For several reasons, the state has, in general, formulated agricultural policy more to the benefit of producers, thus damaging taxpayers and consumers. The main instruments used to protect the producer have been exchange rates and customs tariffs. Domestic agricultural prices have been higher than world prices; thus, through agricultural policy the consumer has financed the producer. Since this expenditure has not been directly visible, it has not attracted much public attention.
Consumers of public goods - urban and rural population
In the period before reform, the urban population put a great deal of effort into obtaining a place in a rural area for relaxation, building cottages or purchasing and restoring rural holdings. About one-third of the urban population spent its free time in the country. In this way the urban population significantly participated in the maintenance of rural villages.
During the reform period, in spite of a considerable decline in real income, town people did not stop spending their free time in rural areas. On the contrary, increasing numbers of the urban public used their rural assets and small plots of land to provide agricultural self-sufficiency. During the reform, however, citizens have been preoccupied by property and ownership problems.
In spite of the direct links of urban people (i.e., three-quarters of the Czech population) with rural areas, the interest of an average citizen in the quality of the environment is to a considerable extent influenced by the prevailing state ideology. This ideology is expressed in slogans like "First economy and later ecology," or "Problems of the environment will be solved through privatisation and through the free market." Under such circumstances, the interests of future consumers are better protected by various opposition political parties (rather left-oriented) and environmental movements.
At present, there are several environmental movements and associations in the Czech Republic that have a small number of members, mostly young and more highly educated citizens. Nevertheless, the movements are well organised and their actions are visible. They are interested in the key environmental problems such as bio-diversity, animal welfare and the links between farming and nature and landscape protection, particularly in protected areas and national parks.
The government has considered some of the environmental movements' activities extremist, and the leading political parties have publicly discredited these movements by labelling them the supporters of the unfettered free market ideology or identifying them with the old structures that existed prior to reforms.
Therefore, the Czech 'green' parties at present have no political weight.
There is an unbalanced representative system in the present Czech Republic, based on the central 'Prague representation' and on the communal representative bodies. A go-between link - a regional representation - is missing. This represents a real block and concentration of interests and financial sources planned for environmental projects on the intermediate level. Nevertheless, the activity of communities on the micro-level is increasing.
In spite of all these shortcomings, the society is becoming more aware of the importance of agriculture and its non-productive functions, especially in the maintenance of landscape. This new role of agriculture also has been underlined in the Agricultural Law, which is under debate in the Parliament at present.
Production of public goods in agriculture
The agricultural policy prior to the reform period was characterised by its total indifference towards the environment and rural landscape. As a consequence of the full self-sufficiency policy, Czech agriculture used highly intensive production methods, and thereby, contributed heavily to the general deterioration of natural resources. The large-scale crop fanning of the state farms depreciated the landscape in many regions.
The attitude of the Czech farmers toward environment did not change substantially during the reform period. Their reduced use of fertilisers and pesticides only occurred because of economic reasons. More than three-quarters of agricultural land is presently still in the hands of extremely large farms: cooperatives, companies and big private farmers with 'industrial' methods of farming. The EU concept of family farming is not economically significant in the Czech Republic.
Currently, agriculture's contribution to the public good is perverse. It is the outcome of: a) the farmers' low 'willingness-to-produce'; b) a research community that is unprepared to promote a new orientation toward agriculture; and c) the obstacles created for land ownership.
During this transformation process farms are using up to 100 percent rented land (70 percent on average). With regards to the externalities, the past situation during which agriculture produced more negative than positive externalities, has at present remained unchanged. The negative externalities are also the outcome of insufficient interest on the part of the farmers and the rural population to protect the common Czech property from the negative effects of their activities.
The role of the state in providing public good from agriculture
During the reform period, the state focused on implementing new environmental legislation, including environmental protection for the air, land, nature and protected landscape areas such as national parks. Almost 13 percent of the state's acreage and about one-fifth of agricultural land is located in protected areas. However, in 1992 the state stopped compensating farmers in protected areas because within these areas farming activities are legally regulated.
The government and the Parliament have been discussing methods and levels of privatisation of natural resources as a part of national welfare. The discussions resulted in either a compromise solution or a postponement of the solution until some future time, especially in the case of water.
The interest of the state in the non-production functions of agriculture has grown since 1993 when the first serious consequences of applied liberal policy became apparent, for instance, the consequences of the abandonment of land and agriculture in several less favourable regions. Led by an interest to improve the farmers' income position in these regions, the state officially introduced direct supports for the maintenance of landscape. The increasing risk of landscape destruction and rural area devastation has forced the Ministry of Agriculture to pressure the government to solve the complex problems of future agricultural and rural development (see the Agricultural Law of 1996^3). The possible entry of the Czech Republic into the EU in the next five to ten years, has caused political institutions and professionals to look for a suitable vision of agricultural development that also considers the new role of agriculture.
^3 The Agricultural Law has two versions' the governmental version, prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, and the parliamentary version, prepared by the Czech Social Democratic Party. In both versions, the law aims to acknowledge the significance of agriculture to environment, landscape and rural development, to establish a legal background for payments to farmers in less favourable areas and for a higher level of protection of agriculture.
Consumers and the agro-food sector: A commentary
by Rolf Moehler
First of all, I would like to say how interesting I found the paper prepared by Tomas Doucha, which gives an excellent overview of the behaviour of the Czech consumers to goods produced by the Czech agro-food sector and the role of the government in these relations. From my perspective the most fascinating aspect is food safety; therefore, I would like to focus on that subject. But I shall discuss food quality, too. Food security and agriculture as a provider of public goods have been discussed already and I can not add very much at this moment.
First, I would like to give an overview of the situation in the European Community (EC), mainly from a legal point of view. Then I shall go through a number of recent events in order to try to explain the European Union (EU) consumers' attitude towards food safety and food quality.
Food safety and food quality
We have to distinguish between food safety and food quality, although there may be some overlap between the issues. Food safety means that a product is safe for the consumer or the animal, i.e., health risks are absent or negligible on the basis of available scientific data. Food quality goes beyond food safety. It means that a product which is safe for the consumer has additional qualities, e.g., its appearance has been improved and/or its nutritional effects provide an added value.
The distinction between food safety and food quality is important, not the least from a regulatory point of view. The regulations adopted either by the Community or by member states are more extensive for food safety than for food quality. In the first 10 to 15 years of the Community, there was a tendency to cover almost everything by Community legislation, but in the end it was discovered to be neither feasible nor possible. Therefore, about 10 years ago, in 1985, a principle was established that a product which is legally produced and marketed in one member state can be marketed freely within the Community unless there are imperative requirements like health risks which allow another member state to block the marketing of the product concerned. This approach has worked well.
Food safety and food quality
Despite the importance of this principle, it does not make Community legislation redundant. In the area of food safety Community legislation mainly covers the following areas: veterinary requirements and control, hygiene, feed and food additives, feed and food contaminants and residues, composition and the life-time of products, objects coming in contact with food and methods of production and storage (e.g., deep freeze, biotechnology). The Community legal system in this area, as in other fields, is a combination of Community and member states legislation. Sometimes Community legislation covers practically the whole subject, while at other times, the Community provides the basic rules which are implemented by member states' legislation. Administration and control are member states' responsibilities. Community legislation is very detailed in veterinary matters, on feed additives, contaminants and residues. On the composition of products, however, the Community only requires
that all the ingredients, in particular additives, are indicated.
In the area of food quality Community legal standards only exist for fruit and vegetables, eggs and poultry. For the rest standard setting is left to operators who are encouraged to set standards. There are, however, exceptions. Community law regulates biological agriculture and the use of geographical indications or designations of origin. It will soon also cover genetically modified food. For biological agriculture the Community has laid down the requirements which must be met by a plant product in order to be marketed as biological, organic or natural.
Similar rules for livestock products are under preparation. Member states apply these rules and they authorise the use of die label 'organic' food or 'biological' food, etc., which is recognised on Community level. The use of geographical indications or designations of origin can be authorised by the European Commission if the criteria spelt out by Community legislation are met, e.g., registration of the denomination. For genetically modified products the main issue is to what extent labelling should be required. I shall come back to this question later.
Some consumer beliefs and values in the European Community
In general, the consumer in the European Community is rather demanding. Food safety is a basic requirement. The consumer reacts strongly to any real or perceived health hazard, as his reactions have shown in the past. But, the consumer not only wants healthy food which looks fresh and good, he also expects that food has maximum nutritional value and has a favourable impact on his life expectancy. Public authorities, whether at the Community or member state level are expected to guarantee food safety. On the other hand, the strong competition which exists in the food sector ensures that producers have a strong interest not only to produce safe but also high quality food responding to the expectations of the consumers. The consumer in the European Community may not be as trusting as the Czech consumer, but nevertheless there is a basic trust in the system as it stands - partly because there is no alternative. There are now some initiatives by consumer organizations who do
their own tests, but that is rather sporadic. Normally the consumer trusts the authorities and also has confidence in the producers because of their strong interest to produce food appreciated by the consumer; otherwise, the producers would be out of the market.
Animal disease
Now, I would like to go through a few events in order to illustrate further the situation. I start with the veterinary field. Broadly speaking, the situation is satisfactory, but we had a few events in the last few years which were worrying but eventually were brought under control. The most recent scare is Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and it gives reason for serious concern.
A few years ago, in 1993, there was a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in southern Italy. The European Commission not only put part of Italy under quarantine but banned all imports from Central and Eastern European countries as the source of the infection was suspected in this area. It is understandable that these measures were conceived as a sort of import protection by the countries affected. As an explanation it would be too simplistic. There was a deep concern that all the efforts in the European Community over the years to ban vaccination and to become free from foot-and-mouth disease would be lost.
The second event which may be mentioned in this context is classical swine fever which broke out first in The Netherlands, then, in 1990, we had an epidemic in Belgium. Then there was a big swine fever outbreak in Germany, in Lower Saxony in 1994. An enormous number of pigs had to be slaughtered. In the beginning, the German authorities were not always happy with the decisions taken by the European Commission. But in the end, they realised that there was no other way to cope with the situation. Despite these cases it is fair to say the veterinary situation is satisfactory. This would be the perception of the consumer, too, were there not BSE.
BSE appeared in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s. It spread rapidly. Resembling scrapie in sheep the risk of transmission to humans appeared to be non-existent or remote, as scrapie was known not to be transmissible to humans. It was like a bomb-shell when, in March 1996, the Advisory Committee on BSE in the United Kingdom reported to the British government that they had detected a new strain of the Creutzfeld-Jacob-disease, and that they had no other explanation for it than transmission of BSE to humans. That of course, lead to a very strong reaction. The European Commission placed an export ban on the UK. Beef consumption dropped by 10 to 15 percent in the Community as a whole, in some member states much more. The drop in beef consumption in Germany, Italy and France was particularly great. In France and Italy it was mainly triggered by press reports that bone- and meat-meal had been imported from the United Kingdom (UK) at a time when its use was prohibited there
already.
How this problem will be solved remains to be seen. Of course, from hindsight we all know better, but one has to assess the decisions taken in the past on the basis of data and scientific advice available at the time and not on our knowledge of today. If you do this, you cannot put much blame on the European Commission for the way it dealt with the problem.
The refusal of the consumer to eat beef expresses his feeling that he has seen something happen which should not have happened. But it goes further than that. It is also a crisis of science, or at least a crisis of the perception of science by the public. Science is often presented as infallible, and ministers make no exceptions, but risk is not absent from science. Science is not an irrefutable store of knowledge, science is first of all a methodology. Through the progress of science, something which was considered safe 10 years ago, may not be considered safe today. The public in the EC has had great difficulty adjusting to shifts in the beliefs of the scientific community. Of course, we have no alternative but to rely on scientists, even when we have doubts about the reliability of their advice. This poses a problem for the consumer who feels confused and mislead.
The BSE case has not undermined the principle mentioned earlier that a product legally produced and marketed in one member state can be marketed throughout the Community. BSE presents a potential health hazard. This is a clear case for an exception, accepted under Community rules.
Growth promoters and genetic modification
The BSE case also has to be seen against the background of other events. The first is the ban on the use of hormones as growth promoters, which has been in effect for ten years. The hormone ban was introduced by the Community under very strong public pressure, particularly coming from the European Parliament. Most scientists, however, agree that there is no health risk involved in using these hormones. They have been used in the US for some time, and no harmful effects have been reported. Some of the hormones that had been banned are naturally occurring hormones. But the hormone ban reflects concern not only that food should be safe and without health hazards, but also that it should be natural. It should be biologically normal - produced in the way nature produces food. To lift the hormone ban would require a change in attitude, and there is no prospect for such a change. In December 1995, the European Commission organised a scientific conference in Brussels which discussed
the problem of growth promoters in animals. The scientists concluded that there was no indication of a heath hazard in the use of hormones. But it seems impossible, unthinkable even, to lift the ban, for political reasons. Because there is very strong pressure from consumers and the European farmers, who want to be seen as producing in conformity with nature. I do not think the Commission will be in a position to propose a change to the Council of Ministers (Council), especially after the BSE crisis.
Another significant issue is BST. BST, developed by Monsanto, increases the yield of milk in cows. To my knowledge the scientific world is in agreement: there is no health hazard. There may be an animal welfare problem involving the cows, but there is no hazard for the human being drinking milk that is produced using BST. The Council, however, have decided to impose a moratorium for the admission of BST in the EU until the end of 1999, in spite the fact that it is used in the US. Again, the perception exists that milk should be produced in a natural way.
My last case is genetically modified organisms. The reticence of the West European consumer towards hormones or BST is also reflected in his attitude towards genetically modified organisms, although they are in current use, without the consumer knowing.
Within the Community there is a procedure to ensure the admission of only genetically modified organisms that cannot harm the environment. The final decision has to be taken by the European Commission after having obtained the opinion of a committee in which the member states are represented. One case to be decided (at the time of this seminar) is that of genetically modified maize. The Commission were in favour of authorising its use; however, there was no majority within the committee in favour of authorisation. Therefore, the matter was sent to the Council and rejected by the Council. The issue was referred back to the different scientific bodies to address concerns related to its building a resistance against antibiotics.^4
^4 The Commission authorised the use of the genetically modified maize in question in December 1996 after having obtained favourable scientific advice.
Apart from the environmental aspect, is the question of labelling organisms that are genetically modified. Right now there is a struggle between the Council and the European Parliament on the extent of food labelling. There is agreement in principle on the need for labelling. The debate is about the extent of labelling necessary. For example, if you have a genetically modified tomato and you use it to produce ketchup, is it necessary to label the ketchup? The Council of Ministers say, "No," the European Parliament says, "Yes." In fact, according to the Parliament, MacDonald's would have to label the ketchup on its hamburgers as made from modified tomatoes.
The Parliament's position reflects a particular feeling of many West European consumers,^5 which seems to be absent in the US, or at least not as strongly felt as it is in Europe. I do not know about the reaction of consumers in Central and Eastern Europe. The feeling concerns, but goes beyond, food safety. At issue is a particular food quality: organic or natural food. It is not a very clear concept, because all food is modified in some way. Man has modified nature as long as he has been in existence. But nevertheless, there is a very strong perception that nature is something which has to be protected, a public good that public authorities, either the Community or member states, must ensure. I think this is the most striking factor we have seen in this debate and it is linked to labelling.
^5 In January 1997, an agreement was reached between the Council and Parliament on the so-called Novel Food Regulation. Labelling is required if the genetically modified organism leads to a 'new' product because of its composition, nutritional value or use. Ketchup is unlikely to need labelling.
The regulation on labelling provides the consumer with the information as to whether a product includes genetically modified organisms or not. It gives the assurance that a product which is not labelled otherwise, is 'natural' in the traditional way. The belief that you need this information is very strong, and I do not see its waning or diminishing in the foreseeable future. An event like BSE, which is assumed to have been transmitted by feeding bone- and meat-meal to bovines, which they do not eat when left to themselves, has the indirect effect of strengthening the feeling that manipulation of nature is wrong, in fact dangerous.
I think these are the main points I wanted to make in this context. Let me say a few words on food security. As I said the first day we met, food security is not an issue anymore, but it was a matter of great concern after the war. Of course, there are still people who cannot afford to pay their food bills, but this is not an agricultural problem.
I will close with an anecdote on this particular point. When I was a student in Bonn in 1951 (a long time ago!) there was a big debate in Germany because the bread price had gone up and the German government at the time prescribed that there should be a cheaper bread. They did not stop the increase in the price of bread. They did not want to go back to price controls. But there was a regulation saying that bakeries had to sell a cheaper bread, "Konsum-Brot." It was a horrible bread because bakeries wanted to sell their more expensive bread. I remember it because I could not afford the other bread, I had to eat this cheap bread, and I still remember it vividly. Of course, today the price of bread is no longer a subject for debate. The discussion now is on the quality of bread, of its nutritional value, what particular bread we get from a given region, and so on.
Group discussion on "Consumers and the agro-food sector"
The discussion was rather limited and focused on two points. First, the question was raised as to whether the accession of the CEE countries into the EU was likely to result in new sets of coalitions around issues of food safety and quality standards, and if so, whether this was likely to change the decisions. It was asserted that at present the proposals that call for the strictest standards and those most commonly adopted come from Germany and the UK. It was expected that this pattern would not be likely to change with accession of new countries, in that just as other present EU countries do not want to be seen as less strict about food safety and health issues than Germany or the UK, neither will any of the CEE countries. Thus, the strict standard levels will be maintained.
There is no doubt that the driving force for strict food safety and food quality standards is coming from the West. The Eastern European countries that want to trade with the EU understand that if a standard is set in the EU and it becomes a rule, it will be applied absolutely 100 percent to products from the East. In fact, producers in the CEE countries are convinced that the EU control is even stricter for them than for products produced in the EU itself. The CEE countries have to be aware of what is going on in the EU, they have to harmonise their regulations with those of the EU, whether or not they agree. They have no opportunity to influence the decisions of the EU in this regard.
The domestic markets, on the other hand, are a different matter. As the transition progressed, consumption became much more segmented than at any time in the previous 20-30 years. Now there is a quality conscious consumer who is very concerned with the quality and safety of the food consumed. On the other end of the spectrum is a growing group of consumers who, because of low incomes, actively look for lower quality food or are willing to trade the risk of contamination for low prices. A relatively large segment of food consumption has shifted to a secondary or unofficial market, including some farmers markets, where there are significant concerns over food safety. Accession will mean having to conform to EU standards in the domestic markets whether or not those standards are truly accepted.
The second point was an agreement that with regard to a whole host of food safety and health related issues in the EU there is a crisis of science. Even though, for example, scientists have so far found no ill effects or danger in beef growth hormones or BST, the EU consumer, with memories of previous disasters, has decided otherwise. In the case of the mad cow disease (BSE) it was more a failure of the politicians than of science, but with the same result - a distrustful public not knowing what to believe about anything that science has to offer.
The situation in Eastern Europe appears mixed. In Hungary the consumer generally feels safe with products that have been labelled properly and have gone through the regular processing and retailing channels. In Poland, on the other hand, science has in the past provided the public and society with conflicting opinions depending on what outcomes were desired by the authorities. For example, when foreign exchange was scarce, coffee was bad for health, in the decades when butter was in short supply it was bad for human health. Now that it is in surplus it is good, especially for growing children. Consumers are disoriented; they do not know whom to believe, with whom to agree or who provides true opinions.

CHAPTER 10 CONCLUSIONS
Major findings and conclusions
Major findings and conclusions
by G.E. Rossmiller and Frances Sandiford-Rossmiller
Overview
The project upon which this book is based began with the hypothesis that there are fundamental differences in values related to agriculture between the countries that presently comprise the European Union and those Central and Eastern European countries that have applied for membership (or indicated their intention to do so at some stage). Moreover, the hypothesis held that differences in beliefs about how those values might be realised would make any accession negotiations difficult at best, and, at worst, would be a source of tension and dissension long after actual accession. At the very least, it was postulated that the values and beliefs brought to the EU table by the Central and Eastern European countries would change the future balance of views and power within the EU by shifting the weight of opinion in as yet unpredictable ways on any given agriculture-related issue.
When we raise these questions, we are focusing on the 40 plus years of communist rule with central planning and little private sector activity that occurred between the aftermath of World War n and the end of the 1980s and early 1990s. Had the post-war communist era not taken place, it is tacitly assumed that Central and Eastern Europe (note the exclusion of the former USSR) would have evolved along lines similar to those of Western Europe. Obviously, the counter-factual evidence does not exist to support or rebut such a heroic assumption: the heroism lies most particularly in the avoidance of the question as to how the individual countries of Western Europe, as well as what is now the European Union, might have evolved during the post-war period had there been no Communist bloc to divide the continent economically and socially, as well as politically and ideologically. One might think especially of pre-democratic Spain, Greece and Portugal, and the economically premature
accession of the last two to the EU to secure their newly democratic regimes. There is, however, lime profit, albeit much pleasure, in speculating and theorising about what might have been. What does lie in our power is to look at where we all are now; where we wish to go; how we see ourselves getting there; and the obstacles that might be encountered. A project of this scope does not aspire to address any of these issues comprehensively, even for the agriculture sector, but maybe it has illuminated some of the rarely seen comers, if only to show what dust and debris have accumulated.
The deliberations of me project workshop indicated that there are indeed a number of fundamental areas of difference with implications for agriculture of which policy-makers within and without the EU should be aware. Some of these differences are between EU member states, and a better understanding of them might be of use in improving intra-EU relations. Others are between me CEE countries and some of the EU member states. The major findings are discussed below. First, we look at what East and West may understand by 'Europe' in order to set the stage for our investigations into the agricultural and rural sectors of the EU and CEE countries. Then we focus on the Common Agricultural Policy, in particular in relation to the family farm, agricultural trade, market intervention policies and consumer food policy, all areas where important divergences of opinion have emerged. Of indirect relevance to the CAP,- but bearing on sectoral efficiency, are differing views about the
agricultural marketing system.
A relatively recent development of agriculture-related EU policy reflects a growing concern in parts of Western Europe about agriculture's impact on and relationship with the natural environment and resource use. Some of these concerns have led to changes in the CAP, and others fall within the ambit of the Environment Directorate. It is argued that the evolution in Western Europe constitutes a policy sea-change, with a new contract between farmers and society being the outcome. Major differences between East and West, as well as within the EU became apparent, and these are discussed within the broad framework of agriculture and the environment.
Finally, we look at the impact of the widely differing views held about the rural areas within which agriculture operates, and the shift towards broader rural and environmental policy from a more narrow focus on agriculture.
The EU and eastward enlargement
As noted in Chapter 2, ten CEE countries have entered into Association Agreements with the EU: the five CEFTA countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia); the three Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia); and two Balkan countries (Romania and Bulgaria).^1 What factors will determine who joins and how quickly? Most Western European sources, including the Commission itself, see future EU enlargement as taking place in phases, the most realistic date for the first wave being 2005 with just three or four countries, including Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, comprising the first wave. Individuals from those three countries (CEE-3) were, therefore, selected for participation in this project.
^1 There are other Associated countries, including Cyprus, Malta and Turkey (whose association is the oldest and of more than thirty years' standing).
The next obvious question is what is it that those countries are joining? Any serious discussion about eastward enlargement of the EU raises questions such as "where is Europe?" and "what is Europe?", as well as "what is the EU?" Although not treated as a separate topic in the project's deliberations, these questions lay just beneath the surface of the papers and occasionally erupted during the discussions. It is worth weaving some of these threads of discussion into a bigger tapestry since they reveal beliefs about the nature of Europe itself, as well as values relating to the Grand European Design laid down in the Maastricht Treaty as the masterplan for the future EU.
If one tries to view the present situation and problems in the Central and Eastern European countries, particularly in relation to Western Europe, through the eyes of those who are living through it and the politicians who are trying to shape the transition and change according to their separate visions, the gap between eastern and western realities might appear to be enormous - even insurmountable. The concern is that the underlying values have diverged so far that lime common ground is left upon which to build a compatible reunification. For reunification it surely is, so one argument runs, when after 40 years a Europe divided (in some areas physically) now has the opportunity and is following the imperative to become a single Europe, however ill-defined and incoherent opinions may be as to what constitutes a 'single Europe.' Such a perspective presupposes, on no historical grounds whatsoever, that there once existed such an entity that was broken, and can now be made
whole again. But despite large shared areas of culture, religion and history, there have always been divisions and divergences, and vastly different historical experiences. For example, a major split with far-reaching consequences - the Great Schism - occurred between Western and Eastern Christendom, i.e., between what became me Roman Catholic West and the Orthodox East; and the fall of Byzantium to the Ottoman empire subsequently split the Orthodox world. Interestingly, discussions today about where the boundaries of 'Europe' lie - 'European countries' with whose perceived values and beliefs Western Europeans feel comfortable enough to accept them as part of the EU - often hark back to those old fault-lines.^2 And where, therefore, are the eastern and southern boundaries of this Europe?
^2 This might be because western Europeans are using some sort of historical geopolitical understanding of their common culture to determine who is an insider and who an outsider.
Although the idea of a reunited Europe is mythical, it is one that has clearly had real importance as a lodestone to point the way out from under the communist yoke. In this understanding, the values perceived to be associated with 'free Europe' underpinned and effectively legitimised the democracy movements. The problems then came during the period of transition when the achievement of the perceived values was found to have a much higher cost than had been anticipated, with the consequence that to a greater or lesser extent the values themselves have been called into question, and even compared unfavourably with some of the values expressed by communism. This is most apparent in the concern over the loss of social protection and cohesion to pay for individual economic freedom. The effect of some of the outcomes of the liberalisation process, such as high levels of unemployment in Poland and Hungary, inadequate safety nets and rising consumer prices in all three countries,
and a rapid fall in agricultural profitability, production and employment has been a disillusionment with the new set of values that has tended to undermine public support for reform. Behind the divergence of values, and subsequent disillusionment, lies something much bigger: the collapse of an entire belief system, a deeply traumatic event for the peoples concerned.
As ever, with history being written by the winners, there has hitherto been relatively hide discussion that seeks to establish what the different countries and regions of Central and Eastern Europe wish to understand by the concept of 'Europe.' It has become at the superficial level simply a western club, synonymous with the European Union, to membership of which most aspire, either openly or privately.^3 But this is not how the EU sees itself. Since Maastricht and Thatcher, the possession of a common EU vision has been attributed to all members except the UK. In fact, this is not true: although the UK has been particularly vociferous and abrasive (even obnoxious) on the subject, other countries, notably the neutrals (Ireland, Sweden and Finland), have serious reservations about the foreign and defence policy 'legs' of the Maastricht Treaty, for example.^4 Beliefs genuinely differ about the values expressed in the 'grand European design,' and the 'broadening' versus
'deepening' debate represents far more than a bad-tempered wrangle about CAP payments and mad cow disease. A European Monetary Union that many believe will fossilise high levels of unemployment and protectionism must raise serious questions about what is offered in return. The equation of Europe with the EU and the EU with Europe is a source of profound difficulty for many people, and concern about the implications of this equation in the aftermath of both the Maastricht Treaty and the collapse of the communist regimes cannot be dismissed lightly. The reunification perspective raises questions about 'European-ness' that are germane to EU enlargement at the conceptual level, as well as to the future within an EU-dominated Europe of those European countries that are excluded from the EU's vision of itself, or that choose to exclude themselves.
^3 This is clearest in the unique case of the two Germanys where "German reunification" meant the absorption of eastern Germany into the Federal Republic of Germany, with all the adjustment that this implied for the eastern way of life and its belief system.
^4 It has been argued that the UK has particular problems with the EU vision and the Maastricht Treaty by virtue of the fact that Britain has no written constitution. The UK, therefore, confuses form with substance, state with process, and takes form very seriously. The British instinct is pragmatic in intention: if codification is necessary at all, then do it when the desired state has been achieved and you know what you want to codify; better still, don't codify at all as it reduces flexibility. The rest of the EU seems to be mostly happy with an idealistic instinct, to regard the form as a symbol of the vision, the starting point for directing future action, not as the outcome of that action.
An alternative perspective is to see the four decades of post-war communist rule as a 'historical discontinuity,' an aberration, a political, social and economic experiment that failed, just as other experiments, such as twentieth century European fascism, failed. This leads to a focus on reintegration rather than reunification - it is time to rejoin the 'mainstream' of European evolution as represented by those countries that did not form part of the Soviet empire, the last of the European empires to break up; to pick up the pieces and move on, with a lag surely relative to the mainstream countries but with little irreversible effect on the underlying social values and beliefs as to what is good, what is bad, what is right and what is wrong. But on this view, it cannot be taken for granted that all CEE countries have similar values and 'European' aspirations (or acceptability). The questions raised by the reintegration view with regard to EU enlargement are more pragmatic.
Gros and Steinherr^5 argue that the conditions that aspiring EU members need to satisfy are quite demanding if EU expansion is to be "positive for the incumbents." Their list is interesting, ranging as it does from the 'grand European design' to the nitty-gritty of CAP prices, and breath-taking in its EU-centricity. (Where the authors use the term 'Visegrad countries,' we have been referring to CEFTA countries.)

It would be helpful if newcomers had political preferences close to those of the EU, taking into account that membership is likely to make preferences more convergent. On that basis Austria was and Hungary will be more readily admitted than Turkey or Belarus. Furthermore, the newcomer should show evidence of an aspiration to become a member of the European family -as is the case of the Visegrad countries - and not be absorbed by internecine struggles. Moreover, to fit into the EU the whole political apparatus of the newcomer must conform to European institutions: democracy, human rights and a decentralised economic structure must be firmly established, otherwise the country could not operate within the political, legal and institutional framework of the EU.
And finally, the level of economic development must be above a certain threshold: first, to be able to keep pace with the speed of integration deepening; and, second, in order not to stretch the structural funds of the EU beyond acceptable levels.
The crucial issue is... money. Eastward expansion will require a radical reform of the CAP to limit the financial cost of accepting new members with an agricultural sector that could explode with current CAP prices.^6
^6 Ibid.
Of course, the actual costs will depend on the details of the CAP itself, the specific candidates for enlargement, the time of accession and the state of the new members agricultural sectors at that time. And indeed the CAP costs are far from being the only important agriculture-related issue: existing member states that are net budgetary contributors may worry about CAP costs (although in EU GDP as opposed to budgetary terms, any increase will be very small), but real opposition to enlargement is much more likely to come from the net recipients who will see their share of the increasingly significant regional and structural funds fall absolutely and relatively.
If the CAP fits...
Part of the disquiet about the EU lies in the apparently deliberate exclusion of so many countries from the decision-making process. The accusation has been made that the EU is trying to prevent new members from having a material impact on any of its major policies both existing and future. As far as the agricultural sector is concerned, the attitude is very much "here is the CAP - take it or leave it," and if you leave it, of course, that means no membership.
Family farms
The most important area of divergence identified by participants in the project between the EU and the CEE-3 (the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland), as far as the Common Agricultural Policy is concerned, lies in the underlying attitudes to the family farm.
The family farm as the societal stabiliser, the epitome of virtue and morality, the conserver of the natural resource base, the steward of the rural areas, in addition to being the guardian of food security, is enshrined in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome. The beliefs surrounding the role of the family farm in Western Europe have elevated it into a 'value,' a standard to be adhered to. Most of the EU's agricultural and agriculture-related policy for rural areas is therefore geared towards assuring the continuity of the family farm.^7 The UK does not share this mystique about the 'family' farm in the same way. Capitalist agriculture with diverse ownership of the factors of agricultural production came very early to England, and the family farm as understood in continental Europe was never the development model. However, while the UK does not hold the family farm as a value in itself, it shares a number of the beliefs about the centrally important role of the farmer, and
superficially the fanning structure appears to be quite similar. The UK has carried out an active agricultural support policy: the underlying differences between the UK and the other EU countries emerge in their differing attitudes towards changes in agricultural structure that would be consequent upon changes in support policy.
^7 The UK does not share the mystique of the family farm as such. For historical reasons (see Chapter 7), it was never seen as a development model.
The EU attitude to the family farm has evolved somewhat over time. In the immediate post-war period the concern for food security in Europe was paramount. The importance of the farmer in society was self-evident as food producer and social stabiliser in a time of great social disruption. Farming was a family affair, and the land passed from father to son through successive generations, providing the sort of permanence and stability not found elsewhere in society. Further, society recognised that the farmer was always at risk, at the mercy of the weather and the market. Society's strong support of agriculture and the family farmer was given expression in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome, and realisation through the Common Agricultural Policy.
All went well with the CAP through the 1960s and early 1970s as agricultural markets expanded. By the late 1970s significant surpluses were accumulating in the then EEC as the effect of high CAP prices were not tempered by supply control measures. Budget costs to deal with surpluses escalated rapidly, and tensions developed with trading partners. Declining agricultural populations reduced the role of agriculture in ensuring social stability although not the role of farmers in representing that stability. With agricultural over-abundance, the old worries about food security faded, to be replaced with concerns about food quality and safety. The environmental costs of the CAP and the agricultural technologies it had encouraged all conspired to tarnish agriculture's golden image. The 1992 MacSharry reforms, under cover of an anticipated GATT Uruguay Round agreement, were an attempt to stem the budgetary haemorrhage and to restore agriculture to public favour.
Now 'agriculture' is not the same thing as 'the farmer' who has generally managed to retain the support of society at large. The nature of that support has changed, partly as a result of the WTO agreement which defined environmental payments as non-distorting of agricultural trade (often called the Green Box), shifting from payments for agricultural production to compensation for producing environmental public goods. But the notion that the family farm must be preserved, nurtured and compensated by society has not died out in the Western Europe of today.
The story in Central and Eastern Europe is very different. Indeed, with the partial exception of Poland, the family farm had been abandoned in favour of state, collective and co-operative farms, usually on a huge scale by Western European standards. While these farms were structurally positioned to capture economies of size, they could not do so because economies of size is not a working concept under central planning. Workers were specialised and waged, and there was neither profit incentive nor entrepreneurial spirit. After the breakdown of central planning, privatisation was based first and foremost on ideas of equity and justice with regard to former ownership, not on creating the conditions for the development of family farms. Even in Poland the family farm was not singled out for any special consideration. It is worth repeating a 1989 quotation made in Chapter 2 by the Prime Minister who was the author of the economic reforms in Poland when asked about agriculture. His
response was:
If somebody would come to me and ask for special preferential credits for agriculture, or for any special treatment of agriculture, I would resign immediately. There is no reason to treat agriculture as a special part of the economy. Mining and ore extracting industries are in a terrible situation, construction industries also. Why not treat construction industries or extracting industries in the same way, as a special case also?
In the Czech Republic agriculture is also viewed like any other sector. In 1994, Minister of Agriculture Josef Lux is quoted as saying:
Ova conception of agricultural policy is based on the output of our producers. It aims for a balance between the interests of the producer and those of the consumer. We will also be concerned with raising quality and with ensuring that food products are healthy through tightened control. The transformation of our agriculture must take account of change in the agrarian policy of the European Union, but it would be a mistake if we were to try to copy current strongly protectionist policies, such as those of Bavaria or Austria. Competition between our agricultural producers and those abroad is desirable, but not when this is underpinned by me states concerned. In comparison with the EU states Czech agriculture has the indisputable advantage of a high concentration of production and of efficiently structured land holdings.
The report to which the above statement is attached^8 goes on to state:
^8 The Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic. Basic Principles of the Agricultural Policy of the Government of the Czech Republic up to 1995 and for a Further Period. Prague, 1994.
The government is aware of the need for a continuing policy of financial support for agriculture. Government subsidies will be targeted in such a way as to support transformation of agriculture in the direction of quality and a market of production which is genuinely saleable, and not to preserve the current survival of non-profitable agricultural production in a number of agricultural concerns and areas.
Three points are important in these statements. There is no mention of family farms, there is no indication that agriculture is special, and to the extent that government support is forthcoming it will be targeted to specific producers to achieve specific objectives. Of course, free-market political rhetoric may hide a multitude of interventionist sins, and agricultural interests will no doubt work hard to establish agriculture's credentials as a special case. But the 'family farm' will not be the guiding principle. Nor, it seems, will food security.^9 The dismantling of the communist era's massive subsidies to agriculture and food consumers, and the disruption of trading patterns have led to problems of surplus disposal and reduced purchasing power - not to food shortages.
^9 The exception is Slovakia, a country not represented in this project, although a CEFTA member. Slovakia has defined food security to be achieved when 90 percent of requirements are produced domestically, and has declared that exports are to be permitted only after this level has been reached.
As CEE-3 agriculture progressively adapts to the market economy, competitive advantage is likely to assume greater importance than any particular type of ownership and management structure. At present there is an uncertainty, an apprehension within the CEE countries about whether CEE agriculture can compete with the West. At the same time there is a recognition that the structural advantage is potentially with the East, although legal institutions and legislation governing property rights have to be established to enable this potential to be realised, particularly perhaps with regard to agricultural tenancies.
The differences in beliefs about the role of the family farm in agriculture, the rural community and society as a whole could lead to some tensions and political difficulties between East and West in the formulation of support versus competitiveness policy for agriculture. An expanded EU is likely to have to confront the question of targeting support as the serious issue of society's willingness to continue paying for agricultural support, either through higher food prices or through the tax system comes under increasing debate. Those farmers who are now receiving the bulk of support might well be cautioned about putting all their targeting hopes on environment and rural development. It is likely that environmental and rural development targeting will not focus on areas that consist mainly of larger farms.
Trade
The implications of the continuation of a thriving family farm as the driving force behind agricultural support policy needs to be looked at more closely. That maintenance of the family farm is a major objective of the CAP is sure. It is also true that the means of policy implementation chosen by the CAP's founding fathers - market intervention to maintain high domestic producer and consumer prices backed up by border measures, originally variable import levies and export restitutions - ensured that agricultural trade policy would become effectively an arm of domestic support policy. This was not inevitable, nor is it irreversible. Denmark and the UK, for example, had liberal trading regimes for agricultural produce before EEC entry that were not incompatible with high levels of domestic support for agriculture, which in Denmark's case centred very much on the family farm as the development model. Nor were the high consumer prices attendant upon the CAP instruments necessary
for achieving the high producer prices that are still believed to be fundamental to the survival of the family farm. Between World War D and EEC accession the UK combined its historical cheap food policy (that ensured the final repeal of the Corn Laws) with good producer support by using deficiency payments: the difference lies in the source of the transfer payments - taxpayer or consumer.
The nature of the CAP support mechanisms (the policy instruments), rather than the fact of support, has been a bone of contention between the EU and its trading partners world-wide, and a source of irritation between some of the EU member states. The CEE countries have long pointed to the trade restrictions consequent upon the CAP mechanisms as being a substantial obstacle to the reconstruction and development of their agricultural sectors, complaining that they have been offered only aid when what they asked for and needed was trade. (Nevertheless, the vast bulk of agricultural trade for each CEFTA country^10 is with the EU rather than other CEFTA members.) There is a very strong belief in the CEE-3 at least that their agricultural sectors can compete with those in the EU, if trade barriers are removed and the playing field levelled. However, this co-exists with an equally strong fear that competition will destroy CEE agriculture unless it is heavily protected, but that is
competition of the form being faced now, i.e., with the EU treasury rather than the EU farmers.
^10 The partial exception is trade between the Czech and Slovak Republics, which is still at high levels because of their recent history as a single state, but declining.
The agricultural policies that the CEE-3 have implemented in the 1990s are in many particulars very far from the CAP. The European Commission are consistently urging the aspiring members to use the time until accession to align their agricultural policies with the CAP, as guided by the Commission, in order to ease the transition. The European Association Agreements are supposed to assist the transition process, not least through progressive opening of agricultural markets, but there is strong feeling on the part of the CEFTA countries that the agricultural trade provisions are at best inadequate and at worst unhelpful. Even if CAP-type policy instruments were affordable for their tax-payers or consumers without massive financial transfers from Brussels, they are not believed to be desirable. Increased trade is seen as a good thing in the CEE, important for economic growth and development. Without the hindrance of agricultural trade policy as an arm of domestic support
policy, the opportunities ought to be great. Expansion is stymied, however, by all those countries and groupings for whom this is not the case, the EU being the worst if not the only culprit. The opinion has been expressed that the danger exists in the CEE countries that trade will become an arm of domestic support policy not willingly but because border measures are the cheapest way of increasing domestic producer prices. But it is extremely questionable whether such a move would be permissible under the GATT agreement.
The genuine commitment to more open agricultural trade on the part of the CEE countries is seen in the creation and development of CEFTA. Most regional trade groupings exclude agriculture, as did CEFTA. It is only a few years since the CEFTA members (with the exception of the Czech Republic) were saying that agriculture was unlikely to be included in the foreseeable future. Yet by late 1996, plans were well advanced for finalising the integration of agricultural trade by 1998. Indeed, CEFTA appears to be fulfilling one of its functions - as a training ground for aspiring EU members -rather well:
Last month's summit meeting of CEFTA heads of government featured acrimonious argument over alleged failure to live up to agreed commitments, grand plans for market liberalisation, heart-searching over possible enlargement, and a squabble over whether the organization should have a headquarters (and if so where). There's no doubt about it, CEFTA is coming to look more like the EU everyday..."^11

Food consumers
The reliance of the CAP mechanisms on high consumer prices is another source of friction. For Denmark, the UK and Ireland, EEC entry involved such substantial rises in food prices that a ten-year derogation period was agreed for adjustment. The UK tried to minimise the pain by zero-rating food for purposes of value-added tax, and to that extent has remained faithful to its cheap food policy. In contrast, Denmark levies VAT on food at the rate of 25 percent, the highest in the EU. By the time of the latest wave of new entrants in 1995, the EU had decided that an adjustment period would no longer be permitted. For those entrants, Austria, Finland and Sweden, the issue was one of falling consumer prices as the national agricultural support levels had been much higher than those of the EU. The CEE countries are expected to adapt to very much higher consumer prices immediately on accession.^12
^12 In 1994, for example, the prices for wheat, milk and beef as a percentage of the EU price were: 73 percent, 33 percent and 40 percent in Poland; 56 percent, 70 percent and 52 percent in Hungary; and 66 percent, 54 percent and 59 percent in the Czech Republic. However, pork was about the same price as in the EU and poultry was not that much lower.
They have a history of heavily subsidised consumer food prices. Although the subsidies were removed early in the transition process, both the level and rate of growth of food prices since have been a very sensitive subject because of low incomes and a high proportion of the household budget spent on food. Certainly the CEE-3 do not suffer from the belief that consumers are rich enough to be able and willing to pay higher than necessary food prices solely in order to transfer income to farmers,^13 but neither is any justification felt for consumer subsidies. This could become a rather explosive issue if under the CAP at the time of accession, relatively poor East European consumers are asked to pay significantly higher food prices to support relatively rich Western European farmers. The VAT on food varies by food-stuff type and between countries in Central Europe. In Poland the VAT is seven percent on most food items, but zero percent for unprocessed agricultural products. In
the Czech Republic the VAT is five percent on basic food-stuffs, with a higher rate of 22 percent for luxury food items, such as caviar. Hungary assesses a 12 percent VAT on basic food-stuffs, and 25 percent on luxury items such as coffee, tea, beer, wine, brandy and soft drinks.
^13 In 1993, per cap GDP and per cap PPP GDP as a percentage of EU levels were: 12 percent and 30 percent in Poland; 20 percent and 38 percent in Hungary; and 16 percent and 47 percent in the Czech Republic.
Given the take-it-or-leave-it attitude of the EU with regard to the CAP (amongst other policies), these sticky points seem to be unlikely to hinder accession discussions. However, it is possible that they could have a bearing on the accession decision if consumers are given the opportunity to vote on membership in a referendum at a time when the domestic economy is still far short of EU norms. The fact that countries such as Greece and Portugal are well below the EU average is likely to be of little consolation to the CEE countries who look to the core EU countries for their standard of comparison.
Marketing system
Another major finding about difference in values and beliefs relates to the CAP only indirectly, but directly to the efficiency and development of the agriculture and food sector, and hence to a CEE country's ability to adapt to the CAP. As the up-stream and down-stream state and parastatal enterprises that served agriculture in the centrally planned economies are dismantled and replaced by private-sector enterprises, the extremely negative attitude towards the middleman that had developed under the communist regimes has persisted. The middleman is viewed as exploitative at best and an outright robber at worst. There may be some justification for this view in those significant number of cases in which the state monopoly was merely replaced by a private one, at least geographically. Interestingly, in the East the multinationals are viewed, by and large, as more responsible than the indigenous private entrepreneurs; in the West they are viewed with a certain amount of
suspicion and concern that they can put themselves beyond the reach of any single nation, and in fact do so in order to pursue their own objectives at the expense of those of the countries within which they operate. On both sides, therefore, there is at least a lingering doubt about the social respectability of free enterprise, and the extent to which farmers are exploited by virtue of their lack of market power.
In many parts of Western Europe, farmers have sought to redress the balance of market power through the formation of purchasing and marketing co-operatives, and in some countries these organizations have become formidably strong. (There is a tendency in places for large powerful co-operatives to transform themselves into private or public limited companies.) Perhaps with the exception of the Czech Republic, the CEE countries have a lasting distrust of the co-operative structure, which was an arm of state control in the communist era, not a grassroots organization controlled by and operated in the interests of its farmer members. The outcome is that the development of new organizations that can support an efficient and effective modem marketing system while being seen to represent farmers' interests fairly is turning out to be a slow process that is hindering agricultural development as a whole.
Environmental policy
In Western Europe, under the broadest interpretation the term environment encompasses a host of disparate concepts, issues and activities. Perhaps the most immediate image that environment brings to mind with respect to agriculture is erosion and chemical pollution. But it includes much more when related to farms and farmers, especially the landscape and scenic impacts of agriculture on the natural environment. The concept of environment as applied to agriculture also includes some of the dimensions of food safety and quality as controlled by the farmer and influenced by production practices - so organic farming and farm animal welfare have found shelter under the 'green' umbrella. Agricultural pollution, broadly defined, and food safety are increasingly subject to restriction and regulation.
Increasingly, in Western Europe farmers are viewed as the producers not only of agricultural products but also of public goods based on countryside amenity and access, and landscape preservation and maintenance, for which they have a right to compensation. However, more and more, farmers are perceived as producing negative externalities as well, not only in the form of erosion and chemical pollution, but also in the form of barnyard smells, noise, traffic congestion with large and slow-moving farm machinery on public roads, and other irritants to the increasingly urbanised population that is repopulating rural areas. While the 'polluter pays principle' is accepted in principle, it is applied less than enthusiastically in respect of agricultural pollution. New schemes are offering farmers the opportunity to be paid for producing 'environmental goods,' and in some cases for not producing negative externalities. In fact, a recurrent theme running through the papers in this
volume and the discussion at the workshop was that society has wearied of supporting farmers to produce agricultural products (or to not produce agricultural products in some cases) for a variety of reasons. Yet society is still convinced that farmers are special and in need and deserving of support. A new alignment of the farmer's needs along these lines and society's interests in the environment and landscape are providing for the emergence of a new social contract between society and the farmer. This new social contract calls for the farmer to produce environmental public goods of value to society, for which society in return is willing to pay the farmer on an ongoing basis.
In Eastern Europe, while the concepts might be the same, and it is recognised that modem agricultural practices are going to have just the same sorts of negative environmental impacts as in the West, the intensity of concern is much less. in the West, the state (purportedly) stands between the polluter and society with restriction and regulation in the public interest. In the East, the polluter until very recently was the state.
When the aim of increased agricultural production conflicted with environmental quality because of the associated negative externalities, the resolution was simple. The environment suffered: resource pricing in the centrally planned economies was not geared towards reflecting relative resource scarcity, and the use of natural resources (water, air and land) for waste disposal was not priced at all with the inevitable overuse that this implies. The belief still prevails in the East that society cannot afford environmental amenities and will not be able to do so until the economies are much more robust. This belief covers both payment for the production of environmental public goods by society and measures to prevent agricultural pollution.
Although concerns about environment and landscape in the CEE countries may lag behind those in the West, it is expected that the eastern farming community will be just as eager to be part of the new social contract and to participate in environmental and landscape schemes as their western siblings as long as EU enlargement brings them under a CAP that makes provision for appropriate payments. Where the divergence of beliefs is likely to cause conflict is where the 'polluter pays principle' is applied to the farmer as a polluter. An example of this is the Nitrate Directive, which is an EU environmental, not an agricultural, policy measure.
Rural policy
For a long time in much of Western Europe, agricultural policy measures centred on the preservation of the family farm have substituted for any real policy for the development of the rural areas. In fact most of the rural development that has taken place under the auspices of the EU has been under the FEOGA part of the EU CAP budget. However, as the agricultural sector declines in absolute as well as relative importance with economic development, and the structure of agricultural production changes, the nature, as well as the magnitude, of agriculture's role in the rural economy changes as well. Changes in the wider economy, particularly with regard to the relocation of many economic activities from city centres to suburban and rural sites, as well as innovations in communications technology, are also having a substantial impact on life in the rural areas. Agricultural policy becomes increasingly limited in its ability to support overall rural development, and so policies
for the rural areas come to assume greater importance with environmental policies playing a major part.
Within the last ten years, the promotion of rural development has become one of the objectives of EU structural policy. This is leading to some tensions within the EU as agricultural interests try to appropriate or divert regional funds to compensate for reductions in agricultural support.
In the CEE countries, there appears to be much more interest in pursuing a broad rural development strategy than in focusing more narrowly on agricultural support policies as such. One of the consequences of the economic reforms has been the loss of social services, such as schools and medical facilities, provided in rural areas by the large-scale, state-subsidised agricultural and industrial entities. Local government, even if reformed, does not have the money to provide equivalent facilities in all locations for a rural population that has in many places declined rapidly in the transition years. There is a fairly widespread belief that many rural areas are in crisis, facing depopulation (and even, perhaps, complete abandonment) and high levels of unemployment among those remaining.
Despite the fact that both sides are approaching rural development from very different starting points, there seems to be a shared belief that rural policy is going to be increasingly important in the future. Agriculture may be necessary for the development of the rural economy, but it is no longer regarded as being sufficient
Similarities and differences
While large differences in fundamental values and in beliefs about those values as well as about facts were expected between me EU and the CEFTA countries as a whole, such appears not to be the case. Rather, the differences within the EU and the differences between the CEFTA countries appear in many cases much greater than the differences between the two country groupings. This suggests that at the EU level the political institutions will find, not a 'we versus they' mentality on most issues but rather different country groupings containing both east and west countries coalescing around any given issue.
While current comparisons among the countries of Eastern and Western Europe are not readily available, recent surveys within the EC-12 are instructive. To a 1993 statement that membership in the EC is a good thing, 80 percent of the respondents from The Netherlands agreed while only 43 percent of the British respondents did so. To the statement that the CAP is a good thing only 15 percent of the Danes and 16 percent of the British agreed while at the other extreme 48 percent of the Irish and 55 percent of the Greeks agreed. This shows something of the disparity of views within the EU and how alignments with Eastern European countries might be likely.
Will any of the aspiring members decide that signing up for the CAP is too high a price to pay for EU membership? Certainly, the Common Fisheries Policy was material in the decisions of Norway and Iceland not to" join the EU, but is agriculture important enough in the CEE-3 to affect the decision? The feeling of the workshop on both EU and CEE sides was that the other benefits - economic and non-economic - of EU membership outweigh any disadvantages of a single policy area - even the CAP. At the moment, the European vision, Europe united or just Europe integrated, still seems to have enough carrying power, although evolutions over the next five to ten years in Western, Central and Eastern Europe are quite unpredictable: the post-Maastricht EU and the post-communist CEE are both processes without precedent.

This publication examines the beliefs and values commonly held in western and central Europe regarding issues related to the food, agricultural and rural sectors, and the effects of these beliefs and values on policy decisions. The analysis focuses on the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include some of the formerly centrally planned economies of central and western Europe. It is argued that, beyond the well-documented economic and political interests of the potential partners, divergences in the country policy positions are largely based on unrecognized or unacknowledged differences in values and beliefs.
