INFORMATION NOTE ASIA-PACIFIC STUDY
At its sixteenth session held in Yangon, Myanmar, in January 1996, the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, which has membership open to all governments in the Asia-Pacific region, decided to carry out an outlook study for forestry with horizon year 2010. The study is being coordinated by FAO through its regional office in Bangkok and its Headquarters in Rome, but is being implemented in close partnership with governments, many of which have nominated national focal points.
The scope of the study is to look at the main external and sectoral developments in policies, programmes and institutions that will affect the forestry sector and to assess from this the likely direction of its evolution and to present its likely situation in 2010. The study involves assessment of current status but also of trends from the past and the main forces which are shaping those trends and then builds on this to explore future prospects. Working papers have been contributed or commissioned on a wide range of topics. They fall under the following categories: country profiles, selected in-depth country or sub-regional studies and thematic studies. Working papers are prepared by individual authors or groups of authors on their own professional responsibility; therefore, the opinions expressed in them do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers, the governments of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission or of the Food and Agriculture Organization. In preparing
the substantive report to be presented at the next session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission early in 1998, material from these working papers will be an important element but will be blended and interpreted alongside a lot of other material.
Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity. FAO welcomes from readers any information which they feel would be useful to the study on the subject of any of the working papers or on any other subject that has importance for the Asia-Pacific forestry sector.

ABSTRACT
The objective of the study was to review past trends on the consumption, production and trade for forest products in the Asia-Pacific region, and to project them to the year 2010.
The outlook is based on an analysis of the development of production, consumption and trade in relation to the performance of economies. The first part of the report reviews the historical (1962-1992) developments of consumption, production and trade of detailed forest products in the region. In the second part, a dynamic spatial equilibrium model of the Asia-Pacific forest sector is applied to forecast the future trends (1993-2010).
The review shows that the forest sector in the Asia-Pacific region has expanded greatly in the last three decades. The total consumption of roundwood has nearly doubled between 1962 and 1992, from 593 million m^3 to 1,161 million m^3, while production increased from 576 million m^3 to 1,100 million m^3 over the same period. The Asia-Pacific region has been the world's largest exporter of tropical hardwoods, led by Malaysia with 13.4 million m^3 in 1992. The Philippines and Indonesia were leading exporters in the 1960s and 1970s, but the exports declined significantly since 1980 due to the imposition of log export bans. On the import side, Japan has been the dominant importer of forest products in the region for decades.
The forecasts indicate that the Asia-Pacific demand for forest products will continue to rise, as rapidly growing economies are concentrated in the region. The total roundwood consumption will reach 1,353 million m^3 by the year 2010, an increase of 20% from the 1992's level. Coupled with the rising consumption, production of forest products will reach 1,300 million m^3 by the year 2010. The region's shares of world's total consumption and production are projected to increase from 33% to 35% and from 32% to 33%, respectively, over that period. While Malaysia will still be the largest exporter, exports from New Zealand, Australia, Myanmar and Papua New Guinea will increase. Moreover, Japan will remain the leading importer, even though its domestic production is projected to increase by 12% between 1992 and 2010.
The market equilibrium model underlying the forecasts gives fully consistent forecasts of quantities produced, consumed and traded, within the Asia-Pacific and between the region and the rest of the world. It also provides forecasts of the market-clearing prices. The real prices of industrial roundwood and sawnwood are projected to increase slowly until the year 2010. The real prices of wood-based panels and of paper and paperboard would change little.

Inconsistencies of the data
In some tables of the review of past trends, it will be found that data are inconsistent. For example, the total imports of a country may not be the same in different tables. This is because the data came from different sources, e.g., the trade statistics reported in FAO Forest Products Yearbook and FAO/ECE Timber Bulletin do not always agree. These inconsistencies have been eliminated in the forecasts. Blank entries in tables indicate data not predicted in this study.

INTRODUCTION
The Asia-Pacific region consists of 55% of world's total population, and has the fastest growing economy among all regions in the world for many years. With such demographic and economic dynamics, its forest sector has expanded greatly over the last three decades. The region's total consumption of roundwood has nearly doubled between 1962 and 1992, from 593 million m^3 to 1,161 million m^3, while production increased from 576 million m^3 to 1,100 million m^3 over the same period. Historically, the Asia-Pacific region has been the world's largest exporter of tropical hardwoods, led by Malaysia with 13.4 million m^3 in 1992. The Philippines and Indonesia were leading exporters in the 1960s and 1970s, but the exports declined significantly since 1980 due to the imposition of log export bans. On the import side, Japan has been and will likely continue to be the dominant importers of forest products within the region and in the world for decades.
It is well expected that the economies in the Asia-Pacific region will continue to have strong performance in the decades ahead, and such development will have tremendous impacts on the region's consumption, production and trade of forest products The specific objectives of this study are:
 To summarize and analyze the current status and historical trends of domestic production and consumption in countries of the Asia-Pacific region. Special attention being given to the trade implications of changing domestic consumption and production;
 To identify the main trade flows within the region and between it and other regions, and characterized their trends;
 To identify apparent key driving forces for trade volume, direction, and changes thereof;
 To propose a methodology for projecting developments in international trade flows of forest products with special reference to countries of the Asia-Pacific region; and
 To forecast future trends (till year 2010) of domestic production and consumption in countries of the Asia-Pacific region.
For the purpose of this outlook, the Asia-Pacific region comprises three developed countries and 28 developing countries and territories (Table 1).
Table 2 shows the five aggregated categories and thirteen products considered in this outlook. They are the commodities defined in the FAO Forest Products Yearbook.
The approach for this outlook for forest products in the Asia-Pacific region is first to review the past trends in the development of production, consumption and trade in the region, and then to develop an Asia-Pacific forest sector model. The report is organized as follows.
Part I of this report reviews and analyzes the historical (1962-1992) developments of consumption, production and trade of forest products in the Asia-Pacific region, by country and product. Part II introduces the main methodology used in developing the dynamic spatial equilibrium model of the Asia-Pacific forest sector (ASIA-PAC), describes the countries/regions and the products included in the model, discusses the demand and supply assumptions, and presents forecasts of the future trends (1993-2010) in consumption, production and trade in the Asia-Pacific and the world. The Appendix contains a bibliography of relevant studies cited or useful for future analysis of the region.

Introduction
This outlook study of the Asia-Pacific forest sector provides quantitative information on historical trends and forecasts of forest products consumption, production and trade in and between the Asia-Pacific region and its trading partners.
The main objective of the study is to analyze the status and trends (till the year 2010) of forest products markets in the countries and regions of the Asia-Pacific and related parts of the world, and to propose a methodology for projecting developments in international trade flows of forest products with special reference to countries in the region.
This summary highlights the main findings of the Asia-Pacific forest products outlook study. It covers current status as well as trends. Forecasts are based on assumptions and constraints that can be changed. The data and computer model should enable FAO staff and others to work with different assumptions and thus make their own forecasts.
The forecasts are based on a market equilibrium model. The method insures that the quantity and price forecasts are fully consistent. For each country and commodity, supply (domestic production plus imports) is equal to demand (final consumption, plus input in other processes, plus exports). Imports and exports, by country and destination are balanced, within the Asia-Pacific region and between Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world. Furthermore, the price forecasts for each commodity are such that they clear markets: at those prices, demands are equal to supplies in each country. The availability of price forecasts as well as quantities should be of great value for policy making and project evaluation.
Demographic and Economic Background
The total population of the Asia-Pacific region accounts for more than half of the world's. It has grown from 1.6 billion to 3 billion between 1952 and 1992. China is the most populous country in the region, with nearly 1.2 billion people in 1992, followed by India with 884 million, Indonesia with 184 million, Japan with 124 million, Pakistan with 119 million and Bangladesh with 114 million. While the population of the Asia-Pacific has grown at the same rate as other regions of the world, China's population growth has been quite low since the 1970s, due to the strictly enforced government population control policy.
The Asia-Pacific remarkable economic growth has improved its standard of living significantly. Real per capita GNP grew slowly until the early 1980s. Since then, growth has accelerated. The region's real per capita GNP tripled between 1962 and 1992, from $438 to $1,310, while the world average grew by 75%, from $1,688 to $2,956.
During the 1980s and early 1990s, the economic development in the Asia-Pacific region was characterized by a sharp acceleration of China's economy, significant growth in newly industrializing economies. (Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea and Singapore) and good progress in the transitional economies of Asia. The developing countries' strong economic performance has been helped by sustained domestic demand and export growth as well as by the favourable impact of policy reforms adopted in recent years. Consumer demand remained strong because of significant gains in disposable incomes during recent years. Investment also has grown strongly in many developing countries, reflecting a rapid rise in private investment and in public spending on infrastructure.
Over the last ten to fifteen years, a number of Asia-Pacific countries, including China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Myanmar and Viet Nam, have been implementing economic reforms, shifting from centrally planned, state-directed regimes to more decentralized, market-oriented economic systems. In some respects, the liberalization of these transitional economies in the Asia-Pacific is parallel to the changes taking place in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Many similar issues have to be faced in the reform process, including the design of macro-economic instruments, and the choice of the organization of enterprises. However, in many respects the Asia-Pacific experience is different, because of its long distinct cultures.
As shown in Table 3, the remarkable economic vigour of the Asian-Pacific region continued to be evident in 1994, with a steady growth rate of 7.5% to 8% per year. In this respect developing Asia continued to outperform by a wide margin both other developing regions (4.9%) and industrial countries (2.8%). These growth rate differences may, however, narrow over the next few years, as the developing countries in Africa, the Middle East and Europe as well as the industrial countries are set to improve economic growth performance. But, the fastest growing economies are still likely to be concentrated in the Asia-Pacific. The top developing countries expected to have fastest growth in 1995 were all in the Asia-Pacific region: China, Viet Nam, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. The forecast growth rates for those countries ranged from 10 to 6% (United Nations 1995).

Status and Trends of Forest Products Consumption, Production and Trade in the Asia-Pacific Region
The forest sector in the Asia-Pacific region has expanded greatly during the last three decades, and overall trends show a rising production, domestic consumption and trade. As in other parts of the world, the major measurable factors affecting consumption of forest products in the region are population growth and macroeconomic growth, i.e. GNP. However, many other influences are relevant, though hard to measure: level of residential investment, technical and economic competitiveness of sawnwood and panels in the building sector, development in electronic media, competitiveness of paper and paperboard for packaging, etc.
Total consumption of roundwood in the Asia-Pacific has nearly doubled between 1962 and 1992, from 593 million m^3 to 1,161 million m^3. The forecasts show that the Asia-Pacific demand for forest products will continue to rise, as rapidly growing economies are concentrated in the region. The total roundwood consumption will reach 1,228 million m^3 by the year 2000 and 1,353 million by the year 2010, an increase of 20%, from the 1992's level. The Asia-Pacific region's share of world's total consumption is projected to increase from 33% in 1992 to 35% by the year 2010.
Coupled with the rising consumption, production of roundwood also increased from 576 million m^3 to 1.100 million m^3 between 1962 and 1992, and is expected to reach 1,179 million m^3 by the year 2000 and 1,300 million by 2010. The region's share of world's total production is forecast to rise from 32% to 33%, between 1992 and 2010.
International trade in forest products has been and will continue to be an important component in many countries' forest products demand/supply balance, whether they be exporters, importers or, as in many cases, both. In the Asia-Pacific region, the majority of countries import more than they export. But there are a number of major international exporters of tropical timber products.
As seen in Part I, the Asia-Pacific region is a net importer of all forest products except non-coniferous sawnwood and plywood. In 1992, the total imports of solid wood products amounted to 63.4 million m^3, accounting for nearly 8% of total consumption, while imports of pulp and paper products totalled 14.8 million metric tons, about 16% of regional consumption. Among all countries, Japan has been the dominant importer of forest products, mostly industrial roundwood, for decades. In 1992, Japan imported 14.5 million cubic meters of logs and 15.5 million cubic meters of chips, particles and wood residues from countries outside the Asia-pacific, i.e. 64% and 94% of total regional imports, respectively. By the year 2010, Japan will remain the leading importer of industrial roundwood in the region with 84 million cubic meters or 80% of the region's total, even though its domestic production is projected to increase 13% between 1992 and 2010.
While the region's exports of forest products to other countries or regions have been small, the Asia-Pacific region has been the world's largest exporter of plywood, led by Indonesia with 8.6 million cubic meters in 1992, which accounted for more than the total imports of countries outside the Asia-Pacific region. The forecasts for 2010 show that Indonesia may still be the largest exporter with 10 million cubic meters.
Fuelwood and charcoal
Historical trends
Fuelwood and charcoal has been and will still be the dominant use of wood in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region. During the last three decades, consumption of fuelwood and charcoal has shown sustained increases, mainly as a consequence of population growth. The region's total consumption increased 83% from 460 million cubic meters in 1962 to 841 million cubic meters in 1992.
Outlook
The total Asia-Pacific consumption is projected to be 930 million cubic meters by the year 2010, a 11% increase over the 1992's level. The top three consuming countries will still be India (282 million cubic meters), China (223 million) and Indonesia (184 million), because of the size of their population (Table 4).

Share
In Japan, New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong, income increase has had a negative effect on fuelwood and charcoal demand, as the regions shifted their energy sources from fuelwood and charcoal to fossil fuels and electricity. This trends is likely to continue, and the consumption of fuelwood and charcoal in Japan is expected to decrease from 856 to 201 million cubic meters, by the year 2010.
As in the past, most countries in the Asia-Pacific region will continue to be largely self-sufficient in fuelwood and charcoal, and imports and exports will be negligible.
Industrial roundwood
Historical trends
During the last three decades, as a consequence of moderate growth in population and rapid growth in the economy, consumption of industrial roundwood in the Asia-Pacific region has shown sustained increases. The total consumption was 320 million m^3 in 1992, about one-fourth of the world's total (Table 5). Many countries showed steady and strong growth, while some countries had slightly declining trends in the past thirty years (Table 5).
Table 5. Industrial roundwood production, imports, exports and consumption (1000 m^3).
The region production of industrial roundwood was 288 Mm^3 in 1992, 18% of the world's total. The largest producers were China with 93 million m^3, Malaysia with 45, Indonesia with 39, Japan with 28, and India with 25 million m^3. Of these countries, Indonesia and Malaysia registered the highest growth in production, while Japan's production has gradually declined since the 1970s. Viet Nam's production grew fast since the end of the war in 1975, and peaked at 5.4 million m^3 in 1987. Oceania countries, led by Australia and New Zealand, also saw significant increases in production in the 1980s. In contrast to other countries, Philippines' production of industrial roundwood has steadily declined from 13 million m' in 1968 to 3.6 million m^3 in 1992, due mainly to the serious depletion of forests.
The Asia-Pacific region imported 68 million m in 1992, over 60% of the world's total imports. The imports expanded very fast until the late 1970s and peaked at 80 million m^3 in 1979 when Indonesia and Malaysia imposed the bans on log exports.
The largest importers in the region have been Japan with 47 million m^3 in 1992, the Republic of Korea with 10 million m^3, and China with 6 million m^3. Japan is also the world's leading importer of industrial roundwood. Its industrial roundwood imports accounted for more than 63% of domestic consumption in 1992, compared with 20% in 1962, 53% in 1972 and 57% in 1982.
The region exported 35 million m of industrial roundwood in 1992, about 30% of the world's total. Exports increased during the 1960s and 1970s until Indonesia restricted log exports in 1980 and Malaysia in 1985. In the 1980s, Malaysia surpassed Indonesia to become the world's leading exporter of industrial roundwood, with 18 million m^3 in 1992.
More than 51% of the Asia-Pacific imports came from other regions. Its exports went mostly to countries in the same region, primarily to Japan. Exports to other regions accounted for less than 1 % of the total. The top three importers in 1992 were Japan with 25 million m^3, the Republic of Korea with 10 million and China with 5 million. The major suppliers to the region were the United States with 13 million m^3, Russia with 5 million, and Chile and Canada with 1 million. The total imports from these countries represented more than 90 % of all imports from outside the Asia-Pacific region.
Outlook
Over the next two decades, consumption of industrial roundwood in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to rise from 320 million m in 1992 to 365 million in 2000 and 422 million in 2010. This represents an annual increase of 2% between 1993 and 2000 and 1.5% for the 2000-2010 period, keeping the same rate of 1.8% growth for the 1982-92 period and lower than the 3.0% growth during the period of 1962-92. The Asia-Pacific share of the world total will rise from 20% in 1992 to 22% in the year 2000 and 23% in 2010, reflecting faster growth in consumption than the world average in the next two decades.
Most countries within the region are expected to increase their domestic consumption of industrial roundwood. China, Japan and Indonesia will remain the top three consumers. China's consumption will increase from 99 million m^3 in 1992 to 122 million in the year 2010. Consumption of industrial roundwood in Japan is projected to rise nearly 53% between 1992 and 2010, from 75 million m^3 to 115 million. The increase in consumption will most likely occur in the wood-based panels and paper and paperboard sectors. Like China, Indonesia will also experience faster growth, and increase its consumption much by the year 2010. Malaysia and India will also become important consumers of industrial roundwood.
To meet the increasing requirements, production in the Asia-Pacific region will rise, from 288 million m in 1992 to 368 million in 2010. The region's world share will be up slightly from 18% in 1992 to 19% in the year 2000 and 20% in 2010. Among all countries, China will remain the largest producer of industrial roundwood in the region by the year 2010. China is expected to be largely self-sufficient in wood supply, and production is forecast to increase from 93 million m^3 to 121 million in 2010. Over the same period, Indonesia would become the second largest supplier of industrial roundwood, with 46 million m in the year 2000 and 57 million in 2010, a 46% increase over the 1992 level. Malaysia will be the third largest supplier with 47 and 48 million in 2000 and 2010 respectively. The forecasts are consistently higher than the projections of 17 million in 2000 and 20 million in 2010 made by Jaakko Poyry (1992), and 24 million in 2000 and 25 million in 2010 made by Simons
Reid Collins (1995).
Japan is also one of the top suppliers of industrial roundwood within the region. Its production is forecast to increase from 28 million m^3 in 1992 to 29 million in the year 2000 and 31 million in 2010. The supply potential of Japan's plantation forests has been estimated at nearly 66 million m per year if managed for maximum biological yield, which is well over twice that of current production level. If such an increase can be realized, Japan could virtually eliminate its dependence on wood imports. A 1987 study published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries, predicted Japan's domestic production of industrial roundwood at 40-43 million m for 1994 and 45-52 million for 2004.
For the Republic of Korea, it is forecast that domestic production of industrial roundwood would decrease slightly between 1992 and 2010.
The total imports by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to rise from 68 million m^3 in 1992 to 94 million in the year 2000 and 105 million in 2010. The expansion of imports would be faster with an average annual growth rate of 2.6% between 1992 and 2000 and 1.1% between 2000 and 2010, compared with 1.9% from 1982 to 1992. The region's world share will, increase slightly from 1992 level of 70% to 76% in 2010.
Japan and the Republic of Korea will still be the top two importers in the Asia-Pacific region over the next two decades. Of the two countries, Japan would almost double its imports of industrial roundwood, while the Republic of Korea's imports would remain stable. China's imports gradually decline. With the projected rising consumption, Japan's imports of industrial roundwood are expected to grow from 47 million m^3 in 1992 to 75 million in 2000 and 84 million in 2010, despite the increasing domestic production. And the share of imports in total consumption will increase from 63% in 1992 to 72% in 2000 and 73% in 2010.
As shown in Table 5, the exports of industrial roundwood from countries in the Asia-pacific region are projected to increase moderately from 35 million m^3 in 1992 to 44 and 51 million in the years 2000 and 2010. The region's share of the world total exports would increase to 37% by 2010. In 2010, the largest exporters in the region are, ranked by volume, Malaysia (18 million m^3), New Zealand (16 million), Australia (8 million), Myanmar (4 million), Papua New Guinea (2.5 million), and China (0.9 million).
Japan will still be the largest importer of industrial roundwood in 2010 with 84 million m, 45% of which will be from countries within the region, and 57% from other parts of the world. Japanese imports will increase by 78% by the year 2010, more than the increase in domestic supply. The United States (16 million m^3) is likely to continue to be the principal supplier of Japanese wood markets, followed by New Zealand (13 million), Malaysia (12 million), Chile (11 million), Australia (7.7 million), Russia (5.3 million), and Canada (2.2 million).
Sawnwood
Historical trends
During the last three decades, the rate of growth in sawnwood world-wide has been slow partly due to substitution by other wood and non-wood materials. Among the products substituting for sawnwood, especially in developed countries, are wood-based panel products - plywood, particle board, and fibreboard, which have grown rapidly in the last three decades. Substitution has been encouraged by two factors: declining prices of wood-based panels relative to sawnwood, and the relative ease with which panels can be installed.
Sawnwood consumption in the Asia-Pacific region nearly doubled between 1962 and 1992, from 53 million m^3 to 105 million (Table 6), an average annual growth of 3%. Its world share dropped from 37% to 24% over the same period. Of the amount in 1992, 55 million m were coniferous sawnwood and 50 million m non-coniferous. The largest consumers were Japan with 38 million m^3, China with 21 million and India with 18 million. The total consumption of those three countries accounted for over 72% of the region's total in 1992.
Table 6. Sawnwood production, imports, exports and consumption (1000 m^3).
The region produced 97 million m^3 of sawnwood in 1992, 84% more than in 1962. During the same time, the Asia-Pacific share decreased from 38% of the world's total in 1962 to 22% in 1992. Of the sawnwood production in 1992, 46 million m^3 were sawnwood and 51 million non-coniferous. The largest producers in the region were Japan, China, India, Malaysia and Indonesia. Of the region's total production, Japan accounted for more than 28%, while China, India, Malaysia and Indonesia had 20%, 18%, 10% and 9% respectively.
The total imports of sawnwood in the Asia-Pacific region increased sharply from 1.6 million m^3 in 1962 to 17 million in 1992, and from 10% to 22% of the world's total. In 1992, more than 10 million m of imports were of coniferous species. Within the region, the largest importers in 1992 were Japan with 10 million m^3, Thailand and China with 1.8 million each, and Australia with 1.2 million.
The Asia-Pacific countries exported about 9.5 million m^3 of sawnwood in 1992, up significantly from 1.5 million in 1962 but slower than the increases in imports. While the region's share of imports rose over the last thirty years, that of exports declined from 28% to 12%. Most of the Asia-Pacific exports were in non-coniferous sawnwood (8 million m^3). New Zealand was the only important exporter of coniferous sawnwood in the region, with nearly 1 million m^3 in 1992, or 62% of the region's total.
The Asia-Pacific region's exports of non-coniferous sawnwood rose rapidly from 1.3 million m^3 in 1962 to 8 million m^3 in 1992, with a peak of 10 million m^3 in 1989. In 1989, however, the Indonesia government levied heavy taxes, which reduced exports. Prior to 1989, Malaysia and Indonesia were the two main exporters of the region. By volume, Malaysia exported more than 51% of the region's total, and Indonesia 27%. Since 1989, Malaysia has continued to dominate the trade in non-coniferous sawnwood, with 5.4 million m^3 exported in 1992, 68% of total Asia-Pacific exports. In contrast, Indonesia's exports dropped to 711 thousand m, or about only 9% in 1992.
Outlook
Over the next twenty years, global sawnwood consumption should continue to grow, although at a reduced rate. The Asia-Pacific region's consumption of sawnwood is projected to increase from 102 million m^3 in 1992 to 125 million in the year 2010 (Table 6). This is an average annual growth rate of only 1.1%, slower than the last thirty years' average of 3.2%. The Asia-Pacific share of the world total consumption is expected to rise from 24% in 1992 to 26% by the year 2010. Although India, China and Indonesia will have sizeable increases in consumption, Japan should still be the leading consumer in the region. Japan's consumption should continue to grow, but at a reduced rate, from 38 million m^3 in 1992 to 40 million m^3 in the year 2010.
The 1992 distribution of the region's consumption was: coniferous sawnwood -52% and non-coniferous sawnwood - 48%. By the year 2010, it will be reversed: coniferous sawnwood - 47 % and non-coniferous sawnwood - 53 %.
Sawnwood production in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow from 96 million m^3 in 1992 to 120 million in 2010. Coniferous production would increase to 53 million m^3, while production of non-coniferous would reach 67 million m^3 in 2010. The region's world share should rise from 23% to 25%. In 2010, the major producers of sawnwood would be Japan with 33 million, India with 21 million m, China with 21 million, and Indonesia with 13 million and Malaysia with 11 million. Of them, India, Indonesia and Malaysia are expected to be self-sufficient, while China and Japan would depend on imports.
The Asia-Pacific imports are expected to be stable between 1992 and 2010, from 17 million m^3 to 19 million. In 2010, 10 million m^3 would be coniferous sawnwood and 9 million non-coniferous sawnwood. The region's share of the world's total, would decrease from 22% to 20%. The largest importer in 2010 would be Japan importing 8 million m^3, almost all softwood lumber. There would be other two countries with imports exceeding 1 million m^3: China (3.6 million) and Thailand (3.4 million m^3).
As shown in Table 6, the exports of sawnwood by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are projected to increase from 11 million m^3 in 1992 to 13 million in the year 2010. The region's share of the world total exports would slightly decrease from 15% to 14% over the same period. The largest exporter in the region in 2010 would be Malaysia with 5 million m^3, almost all non-coniferous sawnwood, accounting for over 55% of the Asia-Pacific region's total exports. Other important exporters in the region would include Indonesia (1.8 million) and New Zealand (1.3 million m).
Wood-based panels
Historical trends
Wood-based panels have a broad diversity of uses in every economy around the world. However, three areas are the most important users: construction, furniture and packaging. Over the last three decades, wood-based panels, veneer and plywood in particular, have been the most dynamic forest products in the expansion of consumption, production and trade in the Asia-Pacific region. While consumption increased markedly in many countries, production and exports have expanded at hitherto unheard of rates, especially in Indonesia, since the early 1980s.
From 1962 to 1992, consumption of wood-based panels in the Asia-Pacific region soared from 2.7 million m^3 to 29 million, 24% of the world consumption (Table 7). Of the total wood-based panels consumption, 2 million m were veneer sheets in 1992, plywood 19 million, particle board 5 million, and fibreboard 4 million. The leading consumers were Japan with 12 million m^3, China with 8 million, the Republic of Korea with 3 million and Indonesia with 2 million. The consumption of those three countries together represented over 85% of the region's total in 1992.
The Asia-Pacific production of wood-based panels increased from 3.2 million m^3 in 1962 to 32 million in 1992, accounting for 26% of the world's total. Veneer sheets production was 2 million m^3, plywood 22.5 million, particle board 4 million, and fibreboard 3.6 million. The largest producers in 1992 were Indonesia with 10.5 million m^3, Japan with 8 million, China with 4.8 million, Malaysia with 3.5 million, and the Republic of Korea with 1.6 million. Of them, Indonesia and Malaysia were self-sufficient in wood-based panels, while others, to some extent, relied on imports.
The Asia-Pacific region was a net exporter of wood-based panels from 1962 to 1992. The total imports of the region amounted to 11 million m^3 in 1992, 45% of the world's total. More than three-quarters of imports were plywood, and most of them were intra-regional trade. The two dominant importers in 1992 were Japan with 4.3 million m^3 and China with 3.4 million, who took 39% and 31% of the region's total imports, respectively. The Republic of Korea also imported sizeable amount of wood-based panels in 1992, about 1.5 million m^3.
Table7. Wood-based panels production, imports, exports and consumption 1000 m^3).
The total exports of wood-based panels in the Asia-Pacific were 655 thousand m^3 in 1962 and 13.7 million in 1992, a constant 55% share of the world's total. While plywood exports represented more than 86% of the total exports of wood-based panels. The major exporters were Indonesia with 8.8 million m^3 and Malaysia with 2.5 million. The main destinations of the two countries' exports were countries within the Asia-Pacific region, but the exports to the United States and the European Union were also significant.
Outlook
The historical trends in wood-based panels consumption will likely continue over the next two decades. The Asia-Pacific region's consumption is expected to increase 38% between 1992 and 2010, from 29 million m^3 to about 40 million. This is an average growth of 2% per year. Over the same period, the world total consumption of wood-based is projected to increase from 121 million m^3 in 1992 to 146 million in the year 2010. Thus, the Asia-Pacific region's share of the world total would rise from 24% in 1992 to 27% by the year 2010.
The 1992 distribution of the region's consumption was: veneer sheets - 7%, plywood - 65%, particle board - 15%, and fibreboard - 13%. By the year 2010, this distribution is forecast to change slightly: veneer sheets - 7%, plywood - 67%, particle board - 14 %, and fibreboard - 12 %.
To meet the increasing requirements, production of wood-based panels in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to increase from 32 million m^3 in 1992 to 42 million by the year 2010. Of the total production in 2010, 2.2 million m would be veneer sheets, 29.7 million plywood, 5 million particle board and 5 million fibreboard. Meanwhile, the region's world share would rise from 26% to 29%. By 2010, the major producers of wood-based panels in the region would still be Indonesia with 13 million m^3 and Japan with 12 million. There would be four other countries with production exceeding 1 million m^3 in 2010: China (5.9), Malaysia (3.5), the Republic of Korea (3) and Australia (1.4).
The Asia-Pacific region is expected to still be a net exporter of wood-based panels by the year 2010. Total imports are projected to increase slightly from 11 million m^3 in 1992 to 12.6 million in 2010, while total exports would rise by 16% from 14 to 16 million. The region's world share is forecast to decrease from 45% to 43% for imports, and decrease from 56% to 49% for exports between 1992 and 2010. China is expected to increase its imports of wood-based panels, mostly plywood, and to replace Japan as the number one importer in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan's imports of wood-based panels are projected to decline from 4.3 million m in 1992 to 2.8 million in 2010. This would be largely due to the accelerating domestic production in Japan. Another country with imports exceeding 1 million m^3 in 2010 would be the Republic of Korea (1.4 million m^3).
Indonesia and Malaysia are expected to dominate other countries in the region in exports of wood-based panels in coming years. As shown in Table 7, the exports of wood-based panels from Indonesia would increase much from 8.8 million m in 1992 to 10.2 million in the year 2010, while those from Malaysia are forecast to drop from 2.5 to 2 million. The exports of these two countries would take 85% of the Asia-Pacific region's total exports. Plywood would account for nearly 97% of wood-based panels originating from Indonesia, and about 72% of those from Malaysia.
Paper and paperboard
Historical trends
Production of paper and paperboard has traditionally been based on softwood resources. Thus North America and the Nordic countries have dominated the production and trade in this sector. It is also a capital intensive industry requiring a higher degree of technical know-how than other forest industries. Therefore, consumption, production and trade of paper and paperboard have taken place mostly among developed countries over the last thirty years. Japan has played a leading role in both consumption and production of paper and paperboard in the Asia-Pacific region.
The rate of growth of paper and paperboard consumption between 1962 and 1992 was between the rapid development of consumption of wood-based panels and the rather stagnant situation for sawnwood. The general evolution of trends in the Asia-Pacific is broadly similar to that of wood-based panels.
The Asia-Pacific region's consumption of paper and paperboard increased from about 11 million metric tons in 1962 to over 69 million in 1992 (Table 8), Its world share, meanwhile, slipped from 41% to 29%. Of the 1992 consumption, 8 million metric tons were newsprint, 20 million printing and writing paper, and 41 million m^3 other paper and paperboard. The largest consumers were Japan with 28 million metric tons and China with 22 million. The combined consumption of the two countries accounted for over 73 % of the region's total in 1992.
Table 8. Paper and paperboard production, imports, exports and consumption (1000 mt).
Production of paper and paperboard in the Asia-Pacific region increased at an average annual rate of 18%, from 10 million metric tons in 1962 to 64 million in 1992, accounting then for 26% of world's total. Of the total production in 1992, newsprint was 6 million metric tons, printing and writing paper 19 million, and other paper and paperboard 39 million. The largest producers in 1992 were Japan with 28 million metric tons and China with 20 million. There were four other countries with production exceeding 2 million metric tons: the Republic of Korea (5.5), India (2.4), Indonesia (2.2) and Australia (2.0). Japan, the Republic of Korea and Indonesia were self-sufficient, while the rest depended on the imports to meet their domestic needs.
The Asia-Pacific region was a net importer of paper and paperboard in the last three decades. The total imports of the region grew to 11 million metric tons in 1992 (29% of world imports) from 955 thousand tons in 1962. About 60% of those imports in 1992 were other paper and paperboard, and newsprint and printing and writing paper accounted for 20% each. The largest importers in 1992 were China with 2.9 million metric tons, Hong Kong with 2.3 million and Japan with 1.2 million. Of Hong Kong's imports, nearly half were re-exported. Australia, Malaysia and Singapore also imported sizeable amount of paper and paperboard in 1992.
Exports of paper and paperboard in the region increased from 316 thousand to 5.2 million metric tons between 1962 and 1992, staying at 14% of the world's exports. In 1992, other paper and paperboard exports represented nearly 76% of total exports. The major exporters were Hong Kong with 1.3 million metric tons and Japan with 1.2 million. China was the main destination for the exports of paper and paperboard from Hong Kong and Japan.
Outlook
The Asia-Pacific region's paper and paperboard consumption is expected to nearly double between 1992 and 2010, from 69 million metric tons to about 128 million. This implies an average annual growth rate of 3.5%. Over the same period, the world total consumption of paper and paperboard is projected to increase from 238 million metric tons in 1992 to 382 million in 2010. Thus, the Asia-Pacific region's share of the world total would rise from 29% in 1992 to 33 % by the year 2010.
Although China's consumption of paper and paperboard is expected to more than double from 1992 to 2010, Japan should still be the largest consumer in the region. Other countries which will have sizeable increases in consumption include the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, India, Australia, Thailand and Malaysia.
In 1992, the distribution of the region's consumption was: newsprint - 11%, printing and writing paper - 29%, and other paper and paperboard - 60%. This distribution is forecast to change to 10%, 36% and 54% respectively by 2010.
Coupled with the growth in consumption, production of paper and paperboard would double from 64 million metric tons in 1992 to 117 million by the year 2010. Of the total production in 2010, 10.4 million metric tons are expected to be newsprint, 45.6 million printing and writing paper, and 62.8 million other paper and paperboard. Over the same period, the region's world share would rise from 26% to 31%. In 2010, the major producers of paper and paperboard in the region would be Japan with 50 million metric tons, China with 40 million, and the Republic of Korea with 10 million. Of those three countries, Japan is expected to be a net exporter, while China and the Republic of Korea would be able to supply nearly 90% and 91%, respective, of their domestic consumption. There would be five other countries in the region producing more than 1 million metric tons in 2010: Indonesia (4.1), Australia (4.0), India (2.9) and Thailand (1.4).
The Asia-Pacific region is expected to remain a net importer of paper and paperboard in the next twenty years. Total imports are projected to increase 55%, from 11 million metric tons in 1992 to 17 million in 2010, meanwhile, the region's share of world total imports would increase from 29% to 37%. China is expected to remain the largest importer of paper and paperboard in the region, and to expand its imports from 2.9 million metric tons to 5.0 million from 1992 to 2010, mostly in other paper and paperboard. Japan's imports of paper and paperboard are projected to decline from 1.2 million metric tons in 1992 to 480 thousand in 2010. This drop would be caused mainly by the significant increases in domestic production in Japan. Four other countries or territories that are expected to have imports exceeding 1 million metric tons in 2010 are Hong Kong (2.6), Malaysia (1.5), the Republic of Korea (1.1) and Singapore (1.2 million).
Total exports of paper and paperboard in the Asia-Pacific region are projected to amount to 6.1 million metric tons in the year 2010, up 32% from the 1992's level. Exports would be 10% newsprint, 39% printing and writing paper and 51% other paper and paperboard. Japan is expected to dominate other countries in the region in exports of paper and paperboard, and its exports would more than double by 2010, accounting for nearly two-third of the region's total. As a result of the expanding exports from Japan and increase in domestic consumption, many countries in the Asia-Pacific region would experience declining exports.
Price Developments
In market economies, prices determine in part the demand and supply of forest products. Price levels are also critical in determining the feasibility of forestry projects. It is, therefore, useful that the methodology to predict consumption, production and trade gave also forecasts of the attendant prices.
Figure 1 presents historical trends and forecasts for industrial roundwood prices in 1992 US dollars at the world level, together with the price of the major forest products manufactured from them. Historically, the price of sawnwood paralleled the price of industrial roundwood, mainly because roundwood is a major part of the total cost of sawmilling, reaching as high as 60-70%.
For the pulp and paper sector, wood costs account for a smaller share of total costs, notably because of high capital costs. However, because the technology is broadly similar all over the world, wood cost is one of the means whereby individual companies seek to gain a comparative advantage (United Nations 1986). Therefore, to some extend, the price trend of paper and paperboard also followed that of industrial roundwood during the last three decades. The strong rise after 1973 was due to high energy costs which declined subsequently. Unlike the price of sawnwood and paper and paperboard, the price of wood-based panels declined and significantly differed from that of industrial roundwood over the long-term. This phenomenon was due largely to the technological improvement in manufacturing which allowed the use of lower quality raw materials.
Price of industrial roundwood remained roughly stable, in real terms, in the world until the early 1970s. Between the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s, the world price of industrial roundwood fluctuated and reached a second peak in 1979/80, at almost the same level as 1974. Since then the price started declining and by 1986 the "gain" of the late 1970s was entirely lost, and the price level around 1992 ($93/m^3) was even slightly lower than that of the early 1960s ($101/m^3). Thus, based on real prices, there was no evidence during the past thirty years, of increasing scarcity in industrial roundwood, world-wide.
Figure 1. Real world prices of wood products, 1962-2010.
The price trends for sawnwood were very similar to those for roundwood. The price peaked in 1974, and was followed by a drop. After 1974, trends stayed flat and began to fall in 1980. Not until the late 1980s, did the price of sawnwood begin to recover, and by 1992 the price level reached $227/m^3, slightly higher than that of the early 1960s ($206/m^3).
The price for wood-based panels fell from $616/m^3 in 1962 to $320/m^3 in 1992. This steady fall in price was made possible mostly by a reduction in costs of production (new processes, economies of scale, cheaper raw material from sawmill residues). Among all panel products, the real prices of veneer and plywood declined more than those of particle board and fibreboard.
The real price of paper and paperboard followed an overall trend similar to that of sawnwood and panels. The price declined during the 1960s and the early 1970s. Thereafter, the world showed a sharp rise in real price in 1973/74, at the time of the energy crisis, but it did not last. After that, the price never came up to the 1974 level, although there were a couple of peaks. Since 1989, the paper industries around the world have experienced a difficult period, with real prices declining in four straight years. But, the price of paper and paperboard began to see a strong recovery inmost parts of the world in 1995.
The price outlook shows that the price of industrial roundwood world-wide will increase slowly over the next twenty years. As a consequence of the rising price of raw material, the prices of sawnwood, wood-based panels, and paper and paperboard will also increase. While the price of paper and paperboard is projected to change little, the price of sawnwood would increase 75%, from $227 per metric ton in 1992 to $397 per metric ton in the year 2010, and the price of wood-based panels would increase 40% from 320/m^3 to 446/m^3, over the same period.

Economic and Demographic Developments
The world
Asia-Pacific region
The world
During the last half century, there have been much economic, demographic and political changes around the globe. Between the early 1950s and the early 1970s, the world economy expanded continuously at unprecedented rates, and such drastic development not only profoundly changed nearly all national economies but also the organization of societies as well. As the result of this economic growth and social and technological changes which made it possible and resulted from it, standards of living, social structures, life styles, and expectations of the future were also changed in many parts of the world (United Nations 1986).
From 1973 on, the structure of the world economy changed. There was a pronounced downswing in the business cycle world-wide, caused essentially by the political and economic events of the "oil crisis". Coupled with this change was increased concern about pollution of the environment and sustainability of natural resources.
After the "oil crisis", several studies were done in the late 1970s and early 1980s of the directions and characteristics of the structural changes which were under way or had taken place in the world economy. They focused on the growth in total GDP, investment levels, inflation rates, "real" interest rates, unemployment rates, growth in labour productivity, and related issues.
Since the late 1980s, the world economy continues to adjust to the new economic realities following the break-up of the Soviet Union and the wave of economic liberalization in Eastern Europe and Asia. Recent macroeconomic experience shows unusual differences in the rates of economic progress across economies and regions as well as a slow recovery in many large economies. These differences reflect the continuing adjustment process in formerly centrally planned economies, drastic policy changes in some developing countries, and adjustments in the industrial world to imbalances that arose during the long economic expansion of the 1980s (World Economic and Social Survey, 1995).
Entering the 1990s, the pace of economic expansion around the world, especially in industrial countries, slowed somewhat, with another recession in 1992 and 1993. Japan experienced one of its most serious economic slowdown in the post-war period. Table 9 shows growth rates of real GNP, between 1988 and 1994. The world economy had a broad and vigorous recovery in 1994, following a few years of slow growth. Industrial countries, transitional economies and the developing world all registered generally improved growth. Economic growth in North America continued and a robust expansion began in Europe. The recession also bottomed out in Japan. Led by Asia-Pacific, growth in the developing regions was generally satisfactory. Among the countries in transition, economic performance in Russia and most other countries of the former Soviet Union remained poor. Several other transitional countries in Eastern Europe, however, had positive rates of growth for the first time in several
years (Asian Development Bank 1995).

The volume of world trade also increased fast over the last decade as import demand of industrial economies recovered, Latin America continued to open its markets and intra-regional trade within Asia expanded rapidly. The successful completion of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the signing of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area (AFTA) along with promising developments in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gave further stimulus to trade.
Today the world is experiencing the most rapid increase in human population ever seen. Each year from now until well into the 21st Century, more than 90 million people will be added to the world total. Public perceptions of global population growth and policy responses to that growth range from pessimistic (population growth is the most pressing problem facing humanity) to optimistic (population growth is not a problem but a motor of economic development). Still, the world population increased from 3.1 billion in 1962 to 5.5 billion in 1992 and is projected to reach approximately 10 billion by the year 2050.
Although populations in other regions are not increasing as rapidly as in Africa, or in Asia, individual countries will see drastic changes. For example, many of the poorer countries of Central and South America are expected to experience great increases in population over the next 30 years. Figure 2 shows the distribution of population world-wide in 1992. Asia has the largest share with 59%, followed by Africa with 13 %, and Europe with 9 %.
Asia-Pacific region
The total population of the Asia-Pacific region in 1992 was 3 billion, or 55% of the world's total. Table 10 shows the population by country and territory in the region from 1962 to 1992. China is the most populous country in the world with nearly 1.2 billion people in 1992, followed by India with 884 million, Indonesia with 184 million, Japan with 124 million, Pakistan with 119 million and Bangladesh with 114 million. While the population of Asia-Pacific has grown at the same rate as other regions of the world, China's population growth has been quite low since the 1970s, due to the strictly enforced government population control policy.
Figure 2. World share in population, 1995 (source: World Resources Institute, 1994).
Asia-Pacific's remarkable economic growth has improved its standard of living significantly. Real per capita GNP grew steadily up until the early 1980s (Figure 3). Since then, it has risen faster. The region's real per capita GNP had tripled between 1962 and 1992, from $438 to $1,310, while the world average grew by 75%, from $1,688 to $2,956, during the same period.
During the 1980s and early 1990s, the economic development in the Asia-Pacific region was characterized by a sharp acceleration in China's economy, significant growth in newly industrialized economies and creditable progress in the transitional economies of Asia. The developing countries' strong economic performance has been helped by sustained domestic demand and export growth as well as by the favourable impact of policy reforms adopted in recent years. Consumer demand remained strong because of significant gains in disposable incomes during recent years. Investment also has shown strong growth in many developing countries, reflecting a rapid rise in private investment and in public spending on infrastructure.

Over the last ten to fifteen years, a number of Asia-Pacific countries, including China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Myanmar and Viet Nam, have been implementing economic reforms, shifting from centrally planned, state-directed regimes to more decentralized, market-oriented economic systems. In some respects, the liberalization of these transitional economies in the Asia-Pacific is parallel to the dramatic changes taking place in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, many similar issues have to be faced in the reform process - the construction of the instruments of macro-economic reforms, for example, and the choice of the organization of enterprises. However, in many respects the Asia-Pacific experience is different, because of its long distinct cultures.
As shown in Table 9, the remarkable economic vigour of the Asian-Pacific region continued to be evident in 1994, with economic growth for Asia being even higher than in 1993 at 8.2%. In this respect developing Asia continued to outperform by a wide margin both other developing regions (4.9%) and industrial countries (2.8%) as a group. These growth rate gaps are, however, likely to narrow over the next few years, as the developing countries in Africa, the middle East and Europe as well as the industrial countries are set to improve economic growth performance. But as in years past, the fastest growing economy will still be concentrated in the Asia-Pacific. The top 10 developing countries which are expected to have faster economic growth in 1995 are all in the Asia-Pacific region. They are, in descending order, China, Viet Nam, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. The forecast growth rates for those countries
range from 10 to 6% (World Economic and Social Survey, 1995).
Figure 3. Population and real GNP per capita in the Asia-Pacific region.
Figure 4 presents the annual growth rates of real GDP from 1980 to 1991 for countries and territories of the Asia-Pacific and the world average. The majority of countries in the region had faster economic growth than the countries in other world regions. The average annual growth rate of real GDP for Asia-Pacific over the period was 5.5%, compared to a world average of 3%. The fastest growing economies were the Republic of Korea with 9.6%, China with 9.4%, and Thailand with 7.8%.
The Asia-Pacific region enjoys a dominant position in the tropical timber and timber products trade of the world. For many developing countries of the region, export of forest products is an important source of foreign exchange earnings. In addition, to capture the benefits flowing from the backward and forward linkages and multiplier effects of forest utilization (in terms of employment, income and value added) countries are taking action to establish and expand processing industries and to increase the share of processed wood products in their exports.

Forest Resources
Of the world's estimated 3.8 billion hectares of forests in 1992, the Asia-Pacific region had over 0.6 billion hectares, or 16% of the total. Table 11 presents the forest land areas in the countries of the region. The top three countries are China with 1.26 billion hectares, Indonesia with 1.09 billion hectares and Australia 1.06 billion hectares. However, larger forest land areas do not necessarily mean more forest reserves. China has more forest land area than Indonesia, but the average volume of growing stock in China is under 100 m^3/ha, while it is about 180 m^3/ha in Indonesia.
Historical data on forest areas for the Asia-Pacific region show a worse deforestation rate, than the world average. Between 1962 and 1992, the forest land area decreased at about 0.47% per year, which is much higher than the world average rate of 0.3% per year. The largest forest land area losses have occurred in Southeast Asia, e.g., 1.7% per year in Thailand, 1.4% in Philippines, 1.1% in Viet Nam, and 0.86% in Malaysia.

The following sections summarize the developments between 1962 and 1992 for the products listed in Table 2 by country and territory. It is essential to review these long-term trends in order to foresee developments in later years. For the sake of simplicity, only broad trends over the thirty-year period are shown, while the detailed series of data are being included on diskettes. It should be noted that in some cases the consumption data (production + imports - exports) are negative. This is due to the inconsistent data on imports and exports, and occurs most frequently in countries and territories which re-export some of their imports, e.g., Singapore and Hong Kong.
<section>a</section>
Fuelwood and Charcoal
Fuelwood and charcoal in the developing countries have been used primarily for household cooking and heating. Therefore, consumption of fuelwood and charcoal in the Asia-Pacific region has shown sustained increases, mainly as a consequence of population growth. Table 12 shows the consumption of fuelwood and charcoal by country and territory, from 1962 to 1992. The region's total consumption in 1992 was 841 million cubic meters, a 85% increase from 1962's level, which is strongly correlated with the rate of population growth, 84%, over the same period. The region's share of world consumption was relatively stable, between 44% and 47%.

The top three consumers within the region are India (258 million cubic meters), China (204) and Indonesia (146). The consumption of these three countries accounts for 72% of the region's total, while their population represents nearly 75% of the total. In contrast to the developing nations in the region, Japan, Australia and New Zealand have experienced a declining trend in fuelwood and charcoal consumption, due to substitution by fossil fuels and electricity.
Tables 13 to 15 show the regional trends in production, import and export of fuelwood and charcoal. Clearly, most countries are largely self-sufficient in fuelwood and charcoal, and imports and exports are negligible. The exceptions are Japan and Hong Kong. In Japan, imports were less than 0.4% of domestic consumption in 1962, but by 1992, they accounted for nearly 70%. This increase in imports mainly substituted the decrease in production. The situation in Hong Kong was opposite. Imports in 1962 accounted for 86% of total consumption in Hong Kong, while the share declined to about 38% by 1992. The largest exporters in the region are Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.

Industrial Roundwood
Industrial roundwood, as defined in FAO Forest Products Yearbook, includes all industrial wood in the rough (sawlogs and veneer logs, pulpwood and other industrial roundwood) and, in the case of trade, chips and particles and wood residues.
As a consequence of moderate growth in population and rapid growth in the economy, consumption of industrial roundwood in the Asia-Pacific region has shown sustained increases, as shown in Table 16. The total consumption in the region was 320 million m^3 in 1992, about one-fourth of the world's total, many countries showed steady and strong growth, while some countries had slightly declining trends.

The largest consumers within the region are China with about 99 million m^3, Japan with 75, Indonesia with 39, Malaysia with 27, and India with 25 million m^3. Japan's consumption peaked in 1973 at nearly 100 million m and appeared to level off since 1980. This trend has paralleled that of the Japanese housing construction, which responded strongly to economic growth. Housing is the single largest end-use market for coniferous roundwood/sawnwood in Japan. Figure 5 displays the Japanese housing starts using wooden and non-wood materials. Housing starts also peaked at nearly 2 million units in 1973. Of the total, about 58% were wooden units and 42% were non-wood. Roundwood consumption has been stable since 1980, because of the rise in housing of non-wood materials which surpassed wooden housing starts in 1985.
Figure 5. Japanese housing starts by construction type, 1965-1993.
Domestic consumption of industrial roundwood increased sharply for Indonesia in 1980 and for Malaysia in 1988, mainly because of the bans on log exports to stimulate domestic processing. By 1992, domestic consumption took nearly all production in Indonesia, and 60% in Malaysia.
Table 17 reports the production of industrial roundwood by country and territory from 1962 to 1992. The total production of the region was 288 mm^3 in 1992, accounting for only 18% of the world's total. The largest producers were China with 93 million m, Malaysia with 45, Indonesia with 39, Japan with 28, and India with 25 million m^3. Of these countries, Indonesia and Malaysia registered the highest growth in production, while Japan's production has gradually declined since the 1970s. Viet Nam's production grew fast since the end of the Viet Nam war in 1975, and peaked at 5.4 million m^3 in 1987. Oceania countries, led by Australia and New Zealand, also saw significant increases in production in the 1980s. In contrast to other countries, Philippines' production of industrial roundwood has steadily declined from 13 million m^3 in 1968 to 3.6 million m^3 in 1992. The reduction was due mainly to the serious depletion of forests. Between 1962 and 1992, the forest land area in
the Philippines decreased by about 40% from 17 million hectares in 1962 to 10 million hectares in 1992.

The Asia-Pacific region's imports of industrial roundwood are shown in Table 18. Total imports were 68 million m^3 in 1992, over 60% of the world's total imports. The imports expanded very fast until the late 1970s and peaked at 80 million m^3 in 1979 when Indonesia and Malaysia imposed the bans on log exports. The largest importers in the region have been Japan with 47 million m^3 in 1992, the Republic of Korea with 10 million m^3, and China with 6 million m^3. Japan is also the world's leading importer of industrial roundwood. Japan's growing fibre deficit is well known. Its industrial roundwood imports accounted for more than 63% of domestic consumption in 1992, compared with 20% in 1962, 53% in 1972 and 57% in 1982.
Like Japan, the Republic of Korea has been very dependent on foreign imports of industrial roundwood, mostly from Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines. Its imports increased from less than one million m^3 in 1962 to nearly 10 million m^3 in 1978. In 1980, Korea's imports suddenly dropped by one-third, to 6 million m^3, mainly because Indonesia restricted its log exports. Since then, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea have strengthened their position. However, a general trend has been for less imports of tropical hardwood and more imports of softwood from the United States. Since 1990, Korea's imports of industrial roundwood showed a strong growth, and reached 10 million m again in 1992. In 1982 imports made up about 71% of Korea's total industrial roundwood consumption, a share that increased to 84% by 1992.

Fuelled by its economic reforms, China's imports nearly doubled between 1978 and 1988, from 8 to 14 million m^3. Since 1989, however, China's imports declined, reflecting new political and economic conditions. Unlike Japan and the Republic of Korea, historically, China had been self-sufficient for industrial roundwood, and imports accounted for less than 2% of its total consumption in 1962. The share had increased to 10% in 1982, but came down to less than 7% in 1992.
As shown in Table 19, the Asia-Pacific region exported 35 million m^3 of industrial roundwood in 1992, about 30% of the world's total. Exports had increased during the 1960s and 1970s until Indonesia restricted log exports in 1980 and Malaysia in 1985. In the 1980s, Malaysia had surpassed Indonesia to become the world's leading exporter of industrial roundwood, with 18 million m in 1992. Other major exporters in the region include Australia with 6 million m, and New Zealand with 5 million m^3. Papua New Guinea and Myanmar also became important suppliers of industrial roundwood. Philippines' exports had, however, declined significantly since the 1980s, and the country became a net importer in 1989. For Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Myanmar, exports were mostly logs, while for Australia, almost all of exports were chips, particles and wood residues.

Table 20 shows the direction of trade in industrial roundwood (wood in the rough) within the Asia-Pacific and with other regions in 1992. The region's total imports of industrial roundwood (wood in the rough) were 44 million m^3, and more than 51% of it came from other regions of the world. The Asia-Pacific exports went mostly to countries in the same region, primarily to Japan. Exports to other regions were insignificant, accounting for less than 1 % of the total. The top three importers of wood in the rough in 1992 were Japan with 25 million m^3, the Republic of Korea with 10 million m^3 and China with 5. The major suppliers to the region were the United States with 13 million m^3, Russia with 5 million m^3, Chile and Canada with 1 million m^3 and the European Union with 27,000m^3. The total imports from these countries represented more than 90 % of all imports from outside the Asia-Pacific region.
Table 20. Direction of trade in industrial roundwood (wood in the rough), in thousand m^3, 1992.
Of the region's total imports of wood in the rough, coniferous and non-coniferous species constituted 55% and 45%, respectively. Tables 21 to 23 summarize the direction of trade in coniferous and non-coniferous industrial roundwood in 1992. New Zealand was the only substantial exporter of coniferous industrial roundwood in the region, with 4.6 million m exported mainly to Japan, the Republic of Korea and China, more than 80% of the imports were from outside the region.

Figure 6 shows the Japanese softwood log imports from major suppliers between 1960 and 1993. The United States and Russia were the main sources, while Chile and Canada each had a small share of the region's import markets. Concomitant with rapid economic growth following World War II and lasting until the oil crisis in the early 1970s, Japan's housing starts registered substantial annual increases, as shown in Figure 5. This trend inevitably boosted Japan's imports of roundwood and sawnwood. Over this period, imports from the United States and Russia increased sharply, while imports from New Zealand and Canada also rose. During the 1970s, as its economy grew, Japan's imports remained relatively stable. However, a significant reduction in imports came at the beginning of the 1980s, triggered by a recession in Japan. By the mid 1980s, imports began to climb as the economy recovered. In the early 1990s, even though the United States remained Japan's largest procurer, the shares
of Russia and New Zealand increased.

Among the non-coniferous species, tropical hardwoods dominated the markets, accounting for about 89% of the total. Virtually all of the trade of tropical hardwoods was within the region itself. Japan led the consuming countries with nearly 19 million m^3, followed by the Republic of Korea with 4 million m^3, and Thailand and China with 2 million m. Malaysia was the single largest exporter of tropical hardwoods with 13 million m^3, or 77% of the region's total exports. Nearly all of them were headed to Asia-Pacific countries.
As for the temperate species, the within region trade was mainly between New Zealand and China, involving about 10% of the region's total imports, more than half of the region's imports were from the United States, and one-fourth from Russia.
Figure 6. Japanese softwood log imports from major suppliers (Source: Robertson and Waggener 1995).
Among the Asia-Pacific's imports of industrial roundwood in 1992, more than one-third were chips, particles and wood residues (see Table 24). These imports came mostly from countries outside the region. Japan was the major importer of chips, particles and wood residues, taking about 93% of the Asia-Pacific total imports. Indonesia was the important exporter within the region, while the United States was the largest supplier among other regions. China, however, was both importer and exporter. According to FAO's Forest Products Yearbook 1992, Australia exported 6 million m^3 of industrial roundwood, mostly chips, particles and wood residues to Japan, although in the U.N.'s Timber Bulletin, Australia was not listed as a major exporter.

Coniferous Sawnwood
Coniferous sawnwood consumption in the Asia-Pacific region totalled 55 million m^3 in 1992, 18% of the global consumption (Table 25). Japan (33 million m^3) and China (12 million m^3) were the largest consumers, comprising over 80% of the region's total consumption. Japan's consumption fluctuated with its economic cycles over the last three decades, and had a generally declining trend. China's consumption had grown steadily until the late 1980s, when it stagnated due to lack of forest resources and substitutions of other materials such as metals and concrete. In recent years, consumption has tended to decline, even though the construction industry has been booming. This phenomenon was not due to market forces, rather it resulted from government policies that required increased use of wood substitutes. In contrast to Japan and China, consumption in the Republic of Korea, India and Australia increased substantially in the 1980s, and together these countries accounted for about
14% of the region's total consumption in 1992.

Production of coniferous sawnwood in the region totalled at 46 million m^3 in 1992, or 15% of the world's total (Table 26). The largest producers in the region were Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, India, New Zealand, and Australia. Of the region's total production, Japan accounted for more than 52%, while China had nearly 25%. Inmost countries, production rose in concert with consumption. In Japan and China, however, production decreased. In Japan, production peaked at 33 million m^3 in 1978 and fluctuated around 25 million m since then. In China, production increased steadily until 1985 to a high of 18 million m^3. After that, China's production decreased to a low of 12 million m^3 in 1992.

Imports and exports of coniferous sawnwood have concerned a few countries in the region. Tables 27 and 28 summarize the import and export trends by country and territory, between 1962 and 1992. Total imports roughly doubled every ten years over the last three decades, and reached 10 million m in 1992, about 13% of the world's total imports. The largest importers in 1992 were Japan with 8.4 million m^3 and Australia with 1 million m^3. China's imports have also gradually increased since 1980.

The Asia-Pacific countries exported very little coniferous sawnwood. The total exports in 1992 were 1.5 million m^3, or only 2% of the world's total. New Zealand was the only important exporter: nearly 1 million m^3 in 1992, or 62% of the region's total.
Table 29 shows the direction of trade in coniferous sawnwood in 1992, among the Asia-Pacific countries and with other parts of the world. The region has been a net importer of coniferous sawnwood. In 1992, the major importers in the region for New Zealand's sawnwood were Australia with 694 thousand m, Japan with 272, China with 66, and Republic of Korea with 42. Outside the region, the United States has been the main destination of New Zealand's coniferous sawnwood. In contrast, the region imported almost one-fifth of the total coniferous sawnwood it consumed from other regions of the world, mostly from North America. In 1992, the region imported 5.6 million m^3 from Canada and 2.1 million m from the USA. Japan (8.4 million m) has been the leading importer of the region, followed by Australia (1.5 million m^3), China (528 thousand m^3) and the Republic of Korea (184 thousand m^3). Figure 7 illustrates the historical trend of Japanese imports of coniferous sawnwood from the
major suppliers. The imports from Canada and USA have increased significantly since 1986. However, since 1990, USA's exports have declined after making steady gains during the 1980s, due to the harvest restrictions related to the Spotted owl and other environmental concerns, meanwhile, Canadian exports have seen strong increases.

Non-coniferous Sawnwood
Total consumption of non-coniferous sawnwood in the Asia-Pacific increased 152% from 20 million m^3 in 1962 to 50 million m^3 in 1992, while its region's share of the world total rose from 25% to 43% (Table 30). The consumption grew faster in India, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Republic of Korea, and Pakistan, while it declined in Japan, Australia and the Philippines. In 1992, the leading consumers were India with 15 million m^3, China with 9, Indonesia with 8, Japan with 5, and Thailand with 3 million m^3.
India registered the fastest growth in consumption during the late 1970s and early 1980s. By 1992, India's consumption accounted for nearly 30% of the region's total. While Indonesia's consumption began to rise in the mid-1970s, the trend changed after the government banned log exports in 1980 and sawnwood exports in 1989. Between 1980 and 1992, consumption doubled from 4 million m^3 to 8 million m^3.
In Malaysia, consumption was cyclic during the 1980s, and fell from 4 to 2 million m^3 between 1983 and 1987. Since then, it has recovered gradually and climbed back to 39 million m^3 in 1992. Non-coniferous consumption in China increased at a faster rate since the economic reform started in 1978, and topped at 11 million m^3 in 1988. After that, however, the consumption began to fall and was about 9 million m^3 in 1992.
Japan's non-coniferous sawnwood consumption experienced tremendous changes over the last three decades. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Japan had a fast growth in consumption corresponding to the rapid post-war economic growth. By 1973 total consumption had reached 12 million m^3. Since the oil crisis, however, consumption began to decline steadily, and by 1992 it dropped back to 5 million m^3, or 13% less than in 1962. The reduction in hardwood sawnwood consumption was due mainly to the competition with softwood species.

Table 31 shows the production of non-coniferous sawnwood, by country and territory, between 1962 and 1992. The total production in the region grew steadily from 21 million m^3 in 1962 to 53 million m^3 in 1989, while its world share rose from 26% to 42%. This growth in production was due to increased demand for tropical hardwood sawnwood from consumers within and outside the region, mostly Thailand, Japan and the European Union. However, since 1990, production has decreased especially in Indonesia, Japan, China, Philippines, and the Republic of Korea. By 1992, the region's share of world production had decreased to 39 %.

In 1992, the major producers of non-coniferous sawnwood were India with 15 million m^3, Malaysia with 9, Indonesia and China with 8, and Japan with 3 million m^3. Malaysia remains the major producer of tropical sawnwood. Both Thailand and the Philippines were producing significant quantities of sawnwood from imported tropical logs, even though production in both countries dropped sharply in 1993, corresponding to a log ban in Sabah, Malaysia (Johnson, 1995).
The imports and exports of non-coniferous sawnwood are in Tables 32 and 33. The Asia-Pacific region imported 7 million m^3 and exported almost 8 million m^3 in 1992, or 43% and 48% of global imports and exports. Thailand led all countries in imports with 1.8 million m^3, a 425% increase from 1982, followed by Japan with 1.6 and China with 1.4 million m^3. Singapore and the Republic of Korea imported almost 1 million m^3 each. Thailand's logging ban, together with its fast growing economy and large furniture and secondary processing industry, are the main reasons for expanded imports. The principal source is Malaysia (74%), followed by Viet Nam and Laos which together account for 24% (Table 34).

Japan's imports also more than doubled between 1982 and 1992, from 678 thousand m^3 to 1.6 million m^3. In 1992, imports accounted for one-third of Japan's consumption. Increased wooden housing starts, a decline in log availability and increasing prices for both logs and substitute materials are responsible for the increase. Japan's main import source has historically been Indonesia until 1990, when the volume was radically reduced. Other important suppliers during the 1980s included Malaysia and the Philippines. As shown in Table 34, in 1992, Japan obtained nearly 41% of its non-coniferous sawnwood from Malaysia, 23% from Indonesia, 9% from China, and more than 25% from outside the Asia-Pacific, mostly from North America.
Prior to the late 1970s, China was generally self-sufficient in non-coniferous sawnwood, and imports were negligible. With the increased consumption and decline in production, import requirements have risen sharply from 293 thousand m^3 in 1982 to 1.4 million m^3 in 1992. Of the 1992's volume, Indonesia supplied 32%, Malaysia 30% and the United States 21 %.
The European Union has been the main outside importer of Asian-Pacific non-coniferous sawnwood. In 1992, the total imports of EU were 1.5 million m, or one-fifth of the region's total exports. Continued economic stagnation in many of Western European countries along with growing environmental concerns contributed to a decline in European consumption of tropical sawnwood in the last few years.

The Asia-Pacific region's exports of non-coniferous sawnwood rose rapidly over the last decades from 1.3 million m^3 in 1962 to 8 million m^3 in 1992, with a peak of 10 million m^3 in 1989 or 57% of global exports. In the latter part of 1989, however, the Indonesia government levied heavy taxes on sawnwood exports, which reduced Indonesia's exports. Prior to 1989, Malaysia and Indonesia were the two main exporters of the region. By volume, Malaysia exported more than 51% of the region's total, and Indonesia 27%. Since 1989, Malaysia has continued to dominate the trade in non-coniferous sawnwood, with 5.4 million m^3 exported in 1992 constituting 68% of total Asia-Pacific exports. In contrast, Indonesia's exports dropped to 711 thousand m^3, or about only 9% in 1992. Table 28 shows that Indonesia's exports in 1992 were 1.3 million m^3, which is much larger than the number in Table 33. This inconsistency may be because some of Indonesia's exports to Singapore were re-exported,
and in the FAO's data (Table 33), re-exported volumes were included in Singapore's total. One can note that the number for Singapore in Table 34 is significantly less than the one in Table 33.
Table 34. Direction of trade in non-coniferous sawnwood, in thousand m^3, 1992.
Of the region's total exports, over 72% went to countries within the region, and one-fifth went to the European Union, primarily the Netherlands and UK. Malaysia's major non-coniferous sawnwood customers are Thailand, the European Union, Japan, China, Republic of Korea, and Singapore. For Indonesia, the leading importers include Japan, China, the European Union, and Singapore.

Veneer Sheets
Apparent consumption of veneer sheets in the Asia-Pacific region have increased steadily since the 1960s, and totalled 2 million m^3 in 1992, 38% of world's total (Table 35). But, the production data reported by FAO exclude veneer sheets used for plywood production. In 1992, among all countries, the largest consumers were Japan with 989 thousand m^3, Malaysia with 438, Thailand with 172, and China with 128 thousand m^3. Figure 8 shows that growth of consumption in Malaysia and Thailand has increased very fast in recent years in connection with the rapid growth of their furniture industry (Johnson 1995). China's consumption started growing in 1978 when the economic reforms began.
Production of veneer sheets (excluding that used in domestic plywood production, Table 36) reached 2 million m^3 in 1992, which was roughly equal to its consumption. In 1992, the largest producers were Malaysia with 1.2 million m, Japan with 289 thousand, and Thailand with 167 thousand m. Malaysia more than doubled its production between 1982 and 1992 and became increasingly dominant in the region. In contrast, production in Japan has been falling, because the tropical veneer and plywood industries are shrinking as the supply of tropical log diminishes. Thailand's production instead rose sharply from 15 thousand m^3 in 1982 to 167 in 1992 because of the demand of domestic industries.
The total imports and exports of veneer sheets for the Asia-Pacific were 954 and 897 thousand m^3 in 1992, both accounted for 37% of the world's total (Tables 37 and 38). The two dominant importers in 1992 were Japan with 738 thousand m and China with 125 thousand, which accounted for 77% and 13% of the region's total imports. Veneer logs in both countries are increasingly scarce, and in 1992 net imports represented 73% of total consumption in Japan and 94% in China.

Malaysia is the leading exporter of veneer sheets in the region. In 1992 it exported 765 thousand m^3, 85% of the region's total exports. Japan and China are primary destination for Malaysia's exports.
Table 39 displays the direction of trade in veneer sheets in 1992. The data on both imports and exports are quite different from those in Tables 37 and 38. Nonetheless, Table 39 shows that the Asia-Pacific region is a net importer of veneer sheets, with only 5% of total exports shipped to other regions of the world and around one-third originating from other regions.
The United States is the leading exporter of veneer sheets to the region.

Plywood
The region total consumption of plywood rose from about 11 million m^3 in 1982 to 19 million in 1992, an increase of 67% (Table 40), meanwhile, its world share also increased from 30% to 41%, in concert with fast demographic and economic growth. The largest consumers of plywood are Japan, China, the Republic of Korea and Indonesia with 9.2, 4.6, 1.8 and 1.5 million m^3, respectively. China experienced the fastest growth during the last three decades. Between 1982 and 1992, China's plywood consumption increased by nearly 4 million m^3.

Production in most countries has risen with consumption. While the region's share was 14% in 1962, by 1992 the Asia-Pacific contributed more than half of the world's total production of plywood (Table 41). The largest producers are currently Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and China. Of them, Indonesia is the world's leading producer of hardwood plywood. Since 1980, as a result of tightening log supplies and export taxes on sawnwood, Indonesia's plywood production has expanded fast and become the country's most important wood industry. By 1992, plywood production in Indonesia had reached 10 million cubic meters, accounting for more than 40% of the regions' total and 20% of the world's. Instead, plywood production in Japan and the Republic Korea declined steadily during 1980s, and imports rose.

The trends in plywood imports and exports are shown in Tables 42 and 43. The major importers are Japan with 3.3 million m^3, China with 2.8, the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong with 1, and Singapore with 0.6 million m^3. Imports of these five countries or territories account for nearly 98% of all Asia-Pacific imports, which increased from 1 to 8.4 million m^3 between 1982 and 1992. Among all countries, China had the fastest growth in imports of plywood. The bulk of China's imports is directed to the expanding construction industry in the southern provinces (Jonhson 1995).
The Asia-Pacific region has been the main source of world plywood exports since the 1970s. It accounted for three-fourth of the world's total in 1992, at 12 million m^3. Of that, Indonesia's and Malaysia's shares were 73% and 14%, respectively. In Indonesia, plywood is an export product, for less than 15% of it is consumed locally. Malaysia is Indonesia's major competitor in plywood trade. Exports from Malaysia grew by almost 50% in 1992, to 1.7 million m^3. China's exports of plywood increased during the 1960s and 1970s, and peaked in 1978 at 1.2 million cubic meters. But since, China's exports have declined significantly. Japan's exports also fell since 1970s, due to the rapid expansion of the domestic market.

Table 44 shows the direction of trade in plywood in 1992. There are some differences between FAO data and UN Statistics. The latter indicate that China has replaced Japan as the world's leading importer of plywood, most trade activity has been intra-regional. The imports from major countries within the region accounted for 96% of total imports, while exports from within represented two-third of total exports. The main importers of plywood from outside the Asia-Pacific are the United States and the European Union, with about 1 million m^3 each.
According to FAO Yearbook data (Table 43), Hong Kong exported 0.4 million cubic meters of plywood, but the data from UN Statistics (Table 44) did not indicate Hong Kong as a main exporter in the region. This could be because Hong Kong re-exported important amount of its imports, mostly to China (Jaakko Poyry, 1992).

Particle Board
Consumption of particle board increased radically in countries of the Asia-Pacific over the last three decades. As shown in Table 45, total regional consumption jumped from 2 million m^3 in 1982 to 4.6 million m^3 in 1992, i.e. from 5% to 11% of global consumption. Although the region's world share is relatively small, several countries had sharp increases in consumption, especially China, the Republic of Korea, and Indonesia (Figure 9). In 1992, China surpassed Japan to become the region's largest consumer of particle board, with almost 1.4 million m^3. Other major consumers are Japan with 1.2 million m^3, the Republic of Korea with 727 thousand, and Australia with 658 thousand. Consumption of Indonesia also grew very quickly since the early 1980s.

Production of particle board doubled between 1982 and 1992, and totalled 4 million m^3 in 1992, or 8% of the world's total (Table 46). The top producers in 1992 were China and Japan with about 1 million m^3 each, Australia with 660 thousand m^3, and Indonesia with 350 thousand. Production increased the fastest in China, most countries are self-sufficient except for the Republic of Korea, which supplied less than 38% of its consumption.
Figure 9. Consumption of particle board in China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia, 1961-1992.
Tables 47 to 49 show the data on imports and exports by country and territory from 1962 to 1992, and the direction of trade in 1992. Clearly, the Asia-Pacific region had very little internal trade and was basically a net importer of particle board. Total regional imports were 868 thousand m^3 and total exports were 387 thousand m^3 While less than 34% of the exports went to countries in other regions, more than half of the imports came from outside the region. Ranked by volume in 1992, the Republic of Korea was the largest importer with 451 thousand m^3, followed by China with 158 thousand and Japan with 125. Indonesia, however, was the dominant exporter, with 116 thousand m^3 (but 246 thousand m^3 according to UN data sources, see Table 49). The United States has been the major supplier for the region, with 229 thousand m^3 in 1992.

Fibreboard
Total regional consumption of fibreboard in 1992 was nearly 4 million m^3, or 24% of the world's total (Table 50). The region's world share has gained substantially from 9% in 1962 to 24% in 1992. The top three consumers are China (1.8 million m^3), Japan (1.1) and the Republic of Korea (418 thousand m^3). Consumption has grown fast in all three countries during the 1980s, in parallel with their economic developments. Thailand's consumption also experienced a fast growth since the late 1980s.

Prior to 1980, most countries had been self-sufficient in fibreboard, and production had risen with consumption. During the 1980s and early 1990s, however, improving economic conditions accelerated the demand for fibreboard (Table 51). In response to consumption, production of fibreboard in the Asia-Pacific increased significantly and reached 3.6 million m^3 in 1992, double the 1982's level. In China, production increased from 707 thousand m^3 in 1982 to 1.5 million m^3 in 1992, while consumption rose from 707 thousand to 1.8 million m^3. In Japan and the Republic of Korea, production also grew substantially over the same period.

As shown in Tables 52 and 53, there was very little trade in fibreboard in the region until the mid-1980s. Total imports/exports had been less than 100 thousand m^3 during that time, accounting for around 3% of the world imports/exports. By 1992, imports had jumped to 722 thousand m^3 while exports increased to 583 thousand m^3. The region's world shares of imports and exports increased also. China led all countries in imports with 295 thousand m^3, about 17% of the country's total consumption. Other major importers include Japan with 155 thousand m^3 and Australia with 95 thousand. For exports, New Zealand was the most important supplier in the region, with 360 thousand m^3 exported in 1992. That is about 68% of the country's total production.
Table 54 illustrates the direction of trade in fibreboard within the region and with other parts of the world, based on UN statistics. It suggests that Indonesia also exported fibreboard, though FAO's Yearbook did not show such data. Almost all of New Zealand's exports were to the countries within the region, more than 52% of the region's imports were from other regions, mostly from the United States.

Wood Pulp
Growth in wood pulp consumption has been slower than growth in paper & board production over the last decades (Figure 10). Since the late 1980s, consumption of both wood and other fibre pulp have levelled off, while the growth of paper & board production remained strong. Recovered paper has become an important raw material for paper manufacture world-wide, accounting for 33% of the fibre input both in developed and developing countries and totalling 86 million metric tons in 1991. In that year, countries in the Asia-Pacific region consumed more than 31 million, and of that, over 6.2 million were imports (Table 55).
Figure 10. Consumption of wood pulp and other fibre pulp versus production of paper & board in the Asia Pacific region.
The region's total wood pulp consumption increased from 6.3 million metric tons per year in 1962 to 24.5 in 1992, with the fastest growth during the 1980s (Table 56). Japan has been the leading consumer of wood pulp (14.3 million metric tons in 1992), followed by China (3.4 million), the Republic of Korea (1.8 million), and Indonesia, Australia and India (1.2 million metric tons each). China, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia and India registered the fastest growth during the 1980s.

The production of wood pulp in the Asia Pacific expanded sharply in response to the rise in consumption during the last decade (Table 57). While the production was virtually static during the 1970s, it increased more than 40% between 1982 and 1992, from 12 to 18 million metric tons. However, given the similar growth in production elsewhere in the world, the region's world share has not changed much since 1970. The largest producers in 1992 were Japan (11.2 million metric tons), China (2.2 million), New Zealand, India and Australia with about 1 million metric tons each.

Figure 11 shows the regional production from 1961 to 1992, along with production of other fibre pulp and production of paper & board. Growth of production had been slower than that of consumption (Figure 10), due mainly to the lack of cheap sources of fibre. In 1992, wood pulp production accounted for about 63% of total pulp production in the region, and less than one-third of the total fibre input.
Total imports have increased steadily over the last decades, from 696 thousand metric tons in 1962 to 7.2 million in 1992 (Table 58). Together with recovered paper imports accounted for an important share of fibre input, as shown in Figures 10 and 11. By 1992, imports from other regions represented more than 22% of the consumption. The main suppliers in 1992 were the United States with 2.6 million metric tons, Canada with 2.2 million, Chile with 367 thousand metric tons, and the European Union with 342 thousand (Table 59).
Figure 11. Production of wood pulp, other fibre pulp, and paper & board in the Asia Pacific region, 1961-1992.
The largest importers in 1992 were Japan (3.1 million metric tons), the Republic of Korea (1.5 million), and China (1.3 million). Imports in those three countries accounted for, respectively, 22%, 82% and 37% of their domestic consumption. Imports have also grown quickly and taken large shares of consumption in Indonesia and Thailand in recent years.
There have been very little exports from countries in the region, a total of only 811 thousand metric tons or 3% of the world's (Table 60). Historically, New Zealand has been the largest exporter in the region: 592 thousand metric tons in 1992, 73% of the region's total. Almost all of New Zealand's exports went to countries within the region.
Japan has been a net importer of pulp for decades. In terms of wood pulp consumed, its self-sufficiency rate declined from 95% in 1962 to 78% in 1992. Underlying this decline is the well-known shortage of domestic pulpwood and an impending decline in by-product chips.

Other Fibre Pulp
Table 61 through 64 show consumption, production, imports and exports of other fibre pulp in the Asia-Pacific region from 1962 to 1992. Although it has increased, the trade in other fibre pulp is still very limited, most countries consume all of their production domestically. Prior to the mid-1970s, other fibre pulp represented only about 6% of the world production of pulp for paper and board, and slightly more than half of that was produced and consumed in the Asia-Pacific region. Since the late 1970s, production and consumption had risen sharply, especially in that region. By 1992, about 16 million metric tons, 11% of the world production/consumption of pulp, was pulp of non-wood fibres. Of this amount, a substantial part was made and used by China (12.6 million metric tons), India (1 million) and Latin America (0.7 million). The total production in the region in 1992 was 14.2 million metric tons, 87% of global production.
Figure 12. Production of wood pulp, other fibre pulp, and paper & board in China, 1961 - 1992.
Other fibre production soared in China during the period of 1984 to 1988, in response to fast increases in paper & board consumption, meanwhile, wood pulp production also increased but not as much as other fibre pulp, due to the country's limited wood resources (Figure 12). The proportion of other fibre pulp had been stable before 1982 at 72%, but increased significantly since then and reached 85% by 1992.
India has been the second largest producer and consumer of other fibre pulp in the region. Its production peaked at 1.7 million metric tons in 1984 and then dropped sharply in 1985 according to FAO data, as shown in Figure 13.

Newsprint
In the three decades since 1962, the Asia-Pacific region's consumption of newsprint increased from 2 to 7.6 million metric tons, and its world share rose from 13% to 24% (Table 65). However, the regional consumption is still small relative to its population, considering that the combined consumption of the United States and Canada is 45% of the world total. The annual average growth was 9.4% in the 1960s, 4% in the 1970s and 4.4% in the 1980s. Per capita consumption of newsprint averaged 2.5 Kg in the region in 1992, while the world average was 5.6 Kg. Within the region, per capita consumption ranged from 37.6 kg in Australia and 30 kg in Japan to 0.74 kg in China and 0.14 kg in Viet Nam. The largest consumers of newsprint are Japan (3.7 million metric tons), China (877 thousand metric tons), Australia (658 thousand), the Republic of Korea (593 thousand), and India (495 thousand).

Literacy is an important factor in the consumption of newsprint and printing and writing paper. An improvement in literacy should result in an increase in the annual consumption of newsprint and printing and writing paper. But, competition of electronic media may work against newsprint consumption, with advertising and news broadcasting moving to electronic media, and electronic information storage and retrieval taking over from paper. Still, income and population remain the underlying source for increase in consumption in the region. Recent economic developments in many countries of the region have boosted their newsprint consumption. In terms of quantity, Japan, the Republic of Korea and China had the largest increases from 1982 to 1992, while on a percentage basis, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, and Pakistan all experienced significant growth.
Only one-third of the countries in the region produce noticeable amount of newsprint. The regional production was 1.6 million metric tons in 1962, and had increased to 6 million in 1992 (Table 66). In the mean time, its world share also climbed from 11% to 19%. Japan is the largest producer in the region: 3.3 million metric tons in 1992. Other major producers include the Republic of Korea with 613 thousand metric tons, China (603 thousand), Australia (446 thousand), New Zealand (379 thousand), and India with 340 thousand metric tons.

Growth of production in most countries was slower than that of consumption, except for few countries such as Indonesia, India, the Philippines and the Republic of Korea. Indonesia's production took off since the mid-1980s and reached 169 thousand metric tons by 1992. Production in the Republic of Korea rose sharply during the 1980s, mainly in response to domestic demand, but it has also been a net exporter of newsprint since the mid-1970s.
Tables 67 to 69 give the imports, exports and direction of trade statistics for newsprint, from 1962 to 1992. For years, the Asia-Pacific region has been a net importer of newsprint. The total imports increased from 442 thousand metric tons in 1962 to 2.1 million metric tons in 1992, while total exports rose only from 88 to 485 thousand metric tons over the same period. Over 78% of the total imports of the Asia-Pacific countries came from other regions: 33% from Canada, 29% from USA, and 16% from the European Union.

Japan led the importing countries with 544 thousand metric tons in 1992, followed by China (277 thousand), Thailand (238 thousand), Hong Kong (223 thousand), Australia (212 thousand) and Malaysia with 202 thousand metric tons. For exports, the major suppliers in the region in 1992 were New Zealand, Japan and Indonesia. Almost all of their exports went to other countries in the region.

Printing and Writing Paper
Asia-Pacific's consumption of printing and writing paper increased from 2.4 million metric tons in 1962 to about 8 million in 1982, and more than doubled to 20 million metric tons by 1992 (Table 70). Its world share also doubled from 15% in the 1960s to 29% in 1992. From 1962 to 1972, the average annual growth rate was 8.5%. In the decade 1972-1982, growth averaged about 8.4%, and from 1982 to 1992 it was 15%.

Printing and writing paper are used mostly for publications and communications, such as magazines, books, forms, photocopying, and general printing. Over the last decades, technological developments and the growth of electronic media have influenced printing and writing paper, both by way of competition and in generating new uses and expanded demand. In recent years the rapid expansion of electronic communications and computers seems to have contributed to a high rate of growth of consumption of this paper grade. A recent study of the United States paper industry by Zhang and Buongiorno (1995) shows that technological developments have resulted in a relative decrease in the use of newsprint, but an increase in the use of other paper grades, including printing and writing paper.
The region's average per capita consumption of printing and writing paper increased from 1.4 kg in 1962 to 6.7 kg in 1992, while the world average rose from 5 kg to 12.8 kg over the same period. The range in per capita consumption within the region is large, from 76.2 kg in Japan and 65.3 kg in Singapore to 0.4 kg in Bangladesh and 0.1 kg in Myanmar in 1992. Like newsprint, the level of consumption of printing and writing paper bears a close relationship to the economic level, as evidenced by the much higher consumption in developed than in developing countries.
The main consumers in the region are Japan (9.4 million metric tons), China (5.9 million), India (1.1 million), the Republic of Korea (987 thousand metric tons), Australia (763 thousand metric tons), and Indonesia (588 thousand metric tons). Significant increases in consumption have occurred in Japan, China and the Republic of Korea since 1982. The combined consumption of these three countries accounted for 81 % of the regional total in 1992, compared to 74% in 1982.

The Asia-Pacific region produced about 19 mmt of printing and writing paper in 1992, 94% of its total consumption (Table 71). In the past decades, production paralleled consumption, and more than doubled between 1982 and 1992, while the world production rose by 74%, most countries in the region have been relatively self-sufficient in this paper grade, especially during the 1960s and 1970s. The leading producers in 1992 were Japan (9.6 million metric tons), China (5.5 million), and India and the Republic of Korea with 1 million metric ton each. In terms of growth, the Republic of Korea's production tripled during the 1980s, while production in both Japan and China more than doubled. Other countries with fast growing production were Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand.

Because of the self-sufficiency noted above, regional imports in 1992 were 2.1 million metric tons or slightly more than 10% of consumption (Table 72). However, imports have been increasing, and they accounted for less than 8% of consumption in 1962, but 9% in 1972. China led all countries in imports in 1992 with 518 thousand metric tons, followed by Australia with 496 thousand, Singapore and Hong Kong with 220 thousand each, and Malaysia and New Zealand with 160 thousand each. China changed from net exporter to net importer and became the region's largest importer almost over night, as shown in Figure 14. There were basically no imports of printing and writing paper in China before 1983. Since then, however, imports have risen steadily, and reaching 550 thousand metric tons in the early 1990s. Net imports accounted for 6% of China's total consumption in 1992. This was mainly due to the accelerated domestic consumption, especially in the fast growing southern provinces where
the printing and publishing industry is developing at an unprecedented rate.
Figure 14. Imports of printing and writing paper in China, 1961 - 1992.
Singapore and Hong Kong have been historically net importers and have no domestic production capacity. Around 17% of the imports by Singapore and Hong Kong were re-exported and the rest were consumed domestically.
The Asia-Pacific imported printing and writing paper mostly from the European Union, according to Table 73, nearly 40 % of the total. Imports from North America accounted for about 9 % and imports from other parts of the world 23 %.
The region exported only 848 thousand metric tons of printing and writing paper in 1992, less than half what it imported (Table 73). Japan and the Republic of Korea appeared to be the region's largest exporters, with 239 and 104 thousand metric tons, respectively, in 1992 (note: the UN data in Table 74 show Japan with 716 and Republic of Korea with 177 thousand metric tons in the same year). China and Indonesia also exported significant amounts that were not recorded in the UN statistics shown in Table 74.
Over 67% of Japan exports went to countries in the region, while 6% went to North America, and 2.3% to the European Union. Similarly close to 62% of the Republic of Korea's exports went to the Asia-Pacific, and about 7% was shipped to the United States (Table 74).

Other Paper and Paperboard
This broad category accounts for 60% of all paper and paperboard and embraces a very wide range of types and end-uses, including all wrapping and packaging paper plus containerboard, folding boxboard, sacks papers, household and sanitary papers and a wide range of speciality papers. Consumption of other paper and paperboard in the Asia-Pacific nearly doubled between 1982 and 1992 and totalled some 41 million metric tons in 1992, of which 15 million in the Chinese market and 15 in Japan (Table 75). The region's world share also increased from 13% in 1962 to 30% in 1992. For years, the combined consumption of China and Japan accounted for more than 75% of the regional total, but the share is shrinking due to the fast growth in other countries and slower growth in Japan. Figure 15 shows the developments of consumption in China, Japan and other Asia-Pacific countries. China's share of the regional total remained about 25% from 1962 to 1982, but had jumped to 37% by 1992. In
terms of volume, it had nearly tripled in ten years. As a result, China has surpassed Japan as the region's largest consumer of other paper and paperboard.

Figure 15. Consumption of other paper and paperboard in the Asia-Pacific region, 1962-1992.
The region's average per capita consumption of other paper and paperboard increased from 3.7 kg in 1962 to 17.7 kg in 1992, while the world average rose from 15.5 kg to 24.9 kg over the same period. The range in consumption within the region is large, from 130 kg in Hong Kong and 123 kg in Japan to 0.2 kg in Laos and Myanmar.
To meet the dramatic increase in consumption, the region's production rose 96% from 20 to 39 million metric tons per year from 1982 to 1992, which is almost the same as the growth in consumption. Like consumption, the bulk of production of other paper and paperboard are concentrated in relatively few countries. In 1992, the major producers were Japan with 16 million metric tons, China with 14 million, and the Republic of Korea with 4 million. These three countries accounted for more than 85% of the total production in the region (Table 76).
Total imports tripled from 2.1 million metric tons in 1982 to 6.4 million in 1992, while total exports more than quadrupled over that period. The imports in 1992 accounted for 24% of the world' total, and exports for 15% (Tables 77 and 78).
The large consumers such as Japan and China were to a substantial degree self-sufficient, but a number of small consumers like Singapore and Papua New Guinea were mainly or totally dependent on imports. In terms of volume, the top three importers in 1992 were China and Hong Kong 2 million metric tons each, and Japan (591 thousand), while the top three exporters were Japan (848 thousand metric tons), China (596 thousand), and the Republic of Korea (389 thousand metric tons). Table 78 shows that Hong Kong exported 1.2 million metric tons of other paper and paperboard.
However, those exports were not recorded in the UN trade data shown in Table 79 possibly because they were re-exported to other countries.

China was a net importer, while both Japan and the Republic of Korea were net exporters. China's net imports soared from 158 thousand metric tons in 1982 to 1.5 million metric tons in 1992, more than 65% of Japanese exports headed to countries within the region, while 18% went to the United States and 8% to the European Union. For China, the majority of exports went to Hong Kong, and some of them might have been re-exported to other countries.
The Asia-Pacific also imported large volumes from other regions of the world. The United States was the largest single supplier of other paper and paperboard to the region, with 1.7 million metric tons or 28% of the total in 1992, followed by the European Union with 901 thousand tons (15%), and Canada with 166 thousand metric tons (3%). The rest of the world provided another 2.4 million metric tons to the region, and more than half were shipped to China (Table 79).

Asia-Pacific Forest Products Model
Price-Endogenous Linear Programming System (PELPS III)

Trade Relationships
To analyze and forecast forest products consumption, production and trade in the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, a dynamic spatial equilibrium model, the Asia-Pacific Forest Products model, or ASIA-PAC in short, was developed with the Price Endogenous Linear Programming System (PELPS III) (Zhang et al. 1993).
Price-Endogenous Linear Programming System (PELPS III)
A useful technique in forest sector modelling is to simulate market equilibria by means of mathematical programming. There have been several applications of the technique over the last two decades. The Price Endogenous Linear Programming System is a general PC-based modelling tool that facilitates the application of this technique. Originally developed for the North American pulp and paper industry, PELPS III can be used for any sector to predict consumption, production and capacity by technology, and trade within or among several regions or countries. The theoretical structure is that of spatial equilibrium in competitive markets. PELPS III solves the equilibrium by maximizing the sum of producer and consumer surplus subject to material balance and capacity constraints in each country or territory. Because material flows throughout the system must balance, it is a powerful way of checking the consistency of current data, and insuring the coherence of forecasts.
The system has been used by the United States and Canadian Forest Services to develop the North American pulp and paper model (NAPAP) and the North American solid wood model (NASAW). The Asia-Pacific Tropical Timber Trade (Market) model of the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) is also based on the PELPS system.
Countries and Regions
The countries and territories included in the model are in Table 80. The demand and supply regions were selected based on the volumes of consumption, production and trade. Within Asia-Pacific, twelve countries are treated individually and the rest are grouped into a single region called "Rest of the Asia-Pacific". The other parts of the world are classified as Canada, the European Union, the United States and "Rest of the World".
Products
The products in the model are in Table 81. They are essentially the same as those in Table 2. Figure 16 displays the wood and non-wood material flows.
Demand
The Asia-Pacific Forest Products model has demand equations of fuelwood & charcoal, coniferous sawnwood, non-coniferous sawnwood, veneer sheets, plywood, particle board, fibreboard, newsprint, printing & writing paper, and other paper & paperboard for all countries and territories listed in the Table 80.

The demand equations assume that demand for forest products is determined by economic activity. Let q[it] (of price p[it]) be the amount of a forest product consumed or imported by a country (or territory) i during period t; with i[it] an index of the price of all other goods and services used in combination with this product to produce an output designated by the variable y[it], which in this study was measured by the real national product. Then, assuming cost minimization under a Cobb-Douglas technology with constant returns to scale leads to the following derived demand:
Figure 16. Wood/non-wood material flows.
According to economic theory, we would expect the price elasticity b to be negative while g should be positive.
The demand equation for each product was estimated for three income groups: "high" (developed market economies), "low" (developing market economies), and "world" (combination of developed and developing economies), based on the country and territory classification of FAO (1994, p.ix).
Commodity prices were weighted averages of unit values of imports and exports, by country and territory. The data on production, imports and exports were obtained from FAOSTAToPC (FAO 1996). GDPs were measured in constant US dollar at 1987 prices, based on GDP in domestic currency, exchange rates, and the US GDP deflator. The data on GDPs, exchange rates, and the US GDP deflator came from the World Tables of the World Bank (1995).
The parameters of demand equation [1] were estimated by analysis of covariance (OLS with one dummy variable for each country and territory, corrected by AR1 when autocorrelation was present). The results in Table 82 show that the equations explained well consumption across countries and over time. GDP elasticities were all positive, as they should, except for fuelwood and other industrial roundwood in high income countries, as expected. GDP elasticities tended to be higher in low-income countries. Price elasticities were low, though statistically and economically significant in many cases.
In this model, prices are endogenous (the equilibrium between demand and supply leads to the prices). So, no assumption have to be made regarding future prices. Only national GDPs are shifters of demands, and are strictly exogenous. Thus, specific scenarios regarding GDP growth had to be developed. The GDP projections available were used until 1997 (IMF 1996). Beyond, it was assumed that the GDP growth rates of countries in the region would tend to converge, though countries with higher current economic growth continued to grow faster until 2010.
The assumptions on the GDP growth rate of each country and territory are summarized in Table 83. The region, which had the fastest growth in the last decade continued to do so in the projections, but at lower rates. For the Asia-Pacific region, growth began at above 8% and then declined progressively to 3% in 2010. Exceptional growth, maintaining 4.5% per year by 2010 was assumed for China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. Parallel but substantially lower rates were assumed for Oceania.
For North America, GDP was projected to grow at between 2 and 2.5% per year throughout the projection period. Chile, viewed as a major player in the region in South America, was expected to grow faster at a rate that would slow down from above 8% per year initially to about 3.5% by 2010. In Europe, growth that began at 2.1% in 1996 (International monetary Fund 1996) was assumed to increase to 2.6% by 2000 and reach 2.3% by 2010. The countries of the former USSR have endured large recessions in the past decade. The projections assume a progressive recovery, ending with a 2.5% GDP growth rate by 2010.

Supply
The supplies of fuelwood and charcoal, industrial roundwood (logs, chips, particles, wood residues, and other industrial roundwood), and other fibre pulp were represented by a reservation price, assumed to be equal to the world price, up to the sustainable production potential. This simple representation of supply implies that the cost of production is constant up to the production potential. Costs and prices would then rise sharply when the potential was reached. The supply of end products and demand for raw materials in each country or territory were linked by input-output coefficients.
The maximum potential roundwood supplies in 1992 and 2010 are shown in Table 84, together with the implied growth rates. Those rates set the maximum growth of supply, the actual supply predicted by the model may be less if conditions are such that it is worth producing only part of the maximum potential. But supply cannot exceed that upper bound.
The state of the world's forests is still not well known. Nevertheless, international cooperation under the FAO has produced forestry information with wide coverage and coherent definitions. Specially important here are the Tropical Forestry Assessment 1980 (FAO 1986), Tropical Forest Assessment 1990 (FAO 1995a) and Forest Resource Assessment 1990 global summary (FRA90, FAO 1995a). The Tropical Forest Assessment compares the forestry situation around the years 1980 and 1990. Country specific data vary widely in quantity and quality. The Forest Resource Assessment 1990 includes developed countries.
These assessments served as the basis to estimate the potential output, i.e. the most countries could produce, in sustainable fashion. The assessment of production potential started from the observed trends in harvests, and increased or decreased them based on informed judgement.
Asia as an aggregate is projected to have a timber supply potential growing at about 1 % per year. This will, as will be seen below, make this fast growing region into a large net importer. The largest countries, China and India are likely to face wood supply constraints. Still, both countries have a long term commitment to forestry, and their annual plantation rate of one million hectares was three times the losses from 1980 to 1990. Furthermore, Japan has an excellent forest resource, which might be more utilized in the future.
In Oceania, New Zealand, and Australia are in an excellent position. As wood suppliers they are exceptions amongst the industrialized countries. They are projected to have some of the highest potential supply growth rates of any country in these projections, near 3% per year.
In North America, forest sector policies and conservation considerations are constraining the potential timber supply of the USA and Canada. The supply scenario assumed less than 0.5% growth in supply potential for the USA and about 1% growth for Canada.
Chile was projected to have one of the highest potential supply expansion rates (2.7% per year), reflecting excellent resources and an expansive forest policy.
For Europe, the trend projections were based in part on the UN-ECE/FAO (UN-ECE/FAO 1993, Pajuoja 1995) assessments. As in North America, there is much uncertainty regarding the effects of environment and agriculture policies on timber supply. The annual growth rate of roundwood supply potential was assumed to be around 0.5% per year.
Roundwood supply in the Former USSR region is constrained more by infra-structure than by biological limits, the best prospects are in the Russian Federation and Belarus. Still, the assumption is that timber supply from the Former USSR group of countries would be only be in 2010 at approximately the 1992 level of production.
In total, the growth rate of the world roundwood supply potential was assumed to be about 1 % per year.

Trade Relationships
The structure and trends of trade in forest products are determined by a wide range of factors of which only the main elements were recognized in this study - levels of demand, costs of wood and other factors of production. Also, recognizing that models of trade in forest products should effectively be global forest sector models (United Nations 1986), this study has concentrated on intra-regional trade between the major importers and the major exporters of the Asia-Pacific while recognizing the inter-regional trade between the major importers/exporters of the Asia-Pacific and other regions.
With the implementation of WTO underway, the member countries are expected to reduce or eliminate trade tariffs and non-trade barriers in the near future. Thus, it was assumed that forest products would be traded freely within the Asia-Pacific region and between it and other countries and territories in the future, moreover, taking into account that the adjustment of trade flows between countries or territories is bound to take time, inertia constraints were introduced to limit trade in a given year to be within a specified fraction of the previous year's trade (Buongiorno and Gilless 1980).

Forecasts and Analysis

Wood-based Panels
Paper and Paperboard
Comparison with the Recent FAO World Outlook for Forest Products
The Asia-Pacific Forest Products model was applied to make preliminary forecasts for the period of 1993 to 2010, based on the assumptions outlined above. After these forecasts are reviewed, better forecasts may be prepared by altering the assumptions and/or introducing constraints on specific variables.
Roundwood
Fuelwood and charcoal
Industrial roundwood
Consumption of roundwood in the Asia-Pacific will continue to rise, as rapidly growing economies are concentrated in the region. Forecast shows that consumption in the region will grow from 1,161 million m^3 to 1,232 million in the year 2000 and 1,353 million in 2010, an increase of 11% and 20% (Figure 17). The Asia-Pacific region should account for 35% of world-wide consumption of roundwood in the year 2010, up slightly from 33% in 1992. Fuelwood and charcoal will continue to take a large share of total roundwood, but decline from 72% in 1992 to 69% in the year 2010.
Figure 17. Roundwood consumption in the Asia-Pacific region and the world, 1962-2010.
Figure 18 shows historical and forecast trends for industrial roundwood prices in 1992 US dollars at the world level. Price of industrial roundwood remained roughly stable, in real terms, in the world until the early 1970s. Between the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s, the world price of industrial roundwood fluctuated and reached a second peak in 1979/80, at almost the same level as 1974. Since then the price started declining and by 1986 the "gain" of the late 1970s were entirely lost, and the price around 1992 ($93/m^3) was even slightly lower than that of the early 1960s ($101/m^3). The price outlook indicates that the price of industrial roundwood world-wide will steadily increase over the next twenty years, and is expected to nearly double by the year 2010.
Fuelwood and charcoal
Use of fuelwood and charcoal has been and will still be the dominant use of wood in the developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region. Total consumption is projected to be 870 million cubic meters by the year 2000 and 930 million by 2010, 7% and 19% over the 1992's level. By the year 2000, the top three consuming countries will still be India (268 million cubic meters), China (212 million) and Indonesia (165 million) (Table 85).
Figure 18. Real world price for industrial roundwood, 1962-2010.
In Japan, New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong, income increase is expected to have negative effect on fuelwood and charcoal demand. As a result, their consumption in 2010 will be lower than current consumption.
Historically, most countries in the Asia-Pacific region were largely self-sufficient in fuelwood and charcoal, and imports and exports were negligible. It is expected that the situation will continue in the future. Thus, demand and supply will be basically balanced in every country and territory in the coming years. Therefore, the forecasts were made under the assumption that there would be no international trade in fuelwood and charcoal.
Industrial roundwood
Consumption of industrial roundwood in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to rise from 320 million m^3 in 1992 to 361 million in the year 2000 and 422 million in 2010 (Table 86). This represents an annual increase of 2.3% between 1992 and 2000 and 1.6% for the 2000-2010 period, around the 1.8% growth for the 1982-92 period but lower than the 3.0% growth during the period of 1962-92. The Asia-Pacific region's share of the world's total will rise from 20% in 1992 to 22% in the year 2000 and 23% in 2010, reflecting a faster growth in consumption than the world average in the next two decades.

Most countries within the region are expected to increase their domestic consumption of industrial roundwood over the next twenty years. Among them, China, Japan and Indonesia will remain the top three consumers. China's consumption will increase from 99 million m^3 in 1992 to 122 million in 2010. Consumption of industrial roundwood in Japan is projected to rise nearly 41% between 1992 and 2010, from 75 million m^3 to 115 million (Figure 19). The increase in consumption will most likely occur in the wood-based panels and paper and paperboard sectors. Similar to China, Indonesia will also experience a faster growth period, and increase its industrial roundwood consumption by the year 2010. Other than these three countries, Malaysia and India will also be important consumers of industrial roundwood in the Asia-Pacific region by the year 2010.
To meet the increasing requirements, the production of industrial round in the Asia-Pacific region is projected to rise, from 288 million m^3 in 1992 to 368 million in 2010 (Table 87). The region's world share will be up slightly from 18% in 1992 to 19% in the year 2000 and 20% in 2010.

China will remain the largest producer of industrial roundwood in the region by the year 2010. China is expected to be largely self-sufficient in wood supply, and production is forecast to increase from 93 million m^3 to 121 million in 2010. Over the same period, Indonesia will become the second largest supplier of industrial roundwood in the Asia-Pacific region, with 46 million m^3 in the year 2000 and 57 million in 2010, which represents 18% and 43% increases over the 1992 levels. Malaysia will be the third largest supplier, with 47 and 48 million m^3 in 2000 and 2010 respectively. Those forecasts are higher than the projections of 17 million in the year 2000 and 20 million in 2010 made by Jaakko Poyry (1992), and 24 million in the year 2000 and 25 million in 2010 suggested by Simons Reid Collins (1995).
According to the Indonesia government's 5-year development plan (Repelita V) outlined in 1988, the target of annual wood harvesting would be 42 million m^3 by the mid-1990s, moreover, the recent FAO study entitled "Situation and Outlook of the Forestry Sector in Indonesia" estimated that wood supply would decline from 39 to about 28 million m^3 between 1990 and 2010 by continuing traditional operations, but would increase to 50 million by the year 2000 and 60 million in 2010 under the development scenario, and would increase to 50 million by the year 2000 and nearly 80 million in 2010 under the intensive development scenario (Jaakko Poyry 1992). Therefore, the present forecast is consistent with the development scenario.
Figure 19. Japanese production and consumption of industrial roundwood, 1962-2010.
In this forecast, Japan is also one of the top suppliers of industrial roundwood within the Asia-Pacific region. Its production increases from 28 million m^3 in 1992 to 29 million in 2000 and 31 million in 2010 (Table 87). As shown in Figure 19, Japan's domestic production of industrial roundwood fell from a peak over 52 million m^3 in 1967 to about 28 million in 1992, and currently accounts for only 37% of the country total industrial roundwood consumption. Past analysts of Japanese domestic timber supply have speculated the potential of an "age of domestic timber", wherein Japan steps-up timber harvest volumes from its expanding plantations to meet an increasing share of domestic demand. However, this has not occurred, due in part to the stable supply on global wood markets and the high wages and labour intensity associated with Japanese forestry (CINTRAFOR, 1994). The supply potential of Japan's plantation forests has been estimated at nearly 66 million m^3 per year if
managed for maximum biological yield, which is well over twice that of current production level. If such an increase can be realized, Japan could virtually eliminate its dependence on wood imports. In a 1987 study the ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Fisheries predicted that Japan's domestic production of industrial roundwood could be 45-52 million m^3 by 2004 (CINTRAFOR, 1994). In that case, the present forecasts would be plausible.
For the Republic of Korea, it is forecast that domestic production of industrial roundwood would drop slightly between 1992 and 2010.
Table 88 shows imports of industrial roundwood by country and territory, between 1992 and 2010. The total imports by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to rise from 68 million m^3 in 1992 to 94 million in 2000 and 105 million in 2010. But the expansion of imports would be first faster then slower with an average annual growth rate of 2.6% between 1992 and 2000 and 1.1% between 2000 and 2010, compared to 1.9% from 1982 to 1992. The region's world share will increase from 70% in 1992 to 76% in 2010.

Japan, the Republic of Korea and Singapore will be the top three importers in the Asia-Pacific region over the next two decades. Of the three countries, Japan and Singapore will be the countries which will have higher rising rate of imports of industrial roundwood, while the Republic of Korea's imports will increase slower. With the projected rising consumption, Japan's imports of industrial roundwood are expected to grow from 47 million m^3 in 1992 to 75 million in 2000 and 84 million in 2010, despite the increasing domestic production. And the share of imports in total consumption will increase from 63% in 1992 to 72% in 2000 and 73% in 2010.
The Republic of Korea's imports of industrial roundwood is forecast to stay at the current level of 10-12 million m^3 for the next twenty years.
China would further reduce its imports of industrial roundwood in the future, from 6.4 million m^3 in 1992 to 2.4 million by the year 2010, accounting for about 2% of total consumption. This declining trend in imports seems reasonable, as China's sawnwood consumption has decreased since the late 1980s, and imports of wood-based panels and paper products have risen sharply, moreover. China's ministry of Forestry has recently included the development of new plantations to provide fibre sources for wood pulping in its ninth "Five Years Planning", and set a goal of increasing woodpulp and paper production capacity from the current level of 350 thousand metric tons to one million metric tons by the year 2000 and three million metric tons by 2010 (Chinese ministry of Forestry 1994).

As shown in Table 89, the exports of industrial roundwood by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are projected to increase moderately from 35 million m^3 in 1992 to 44 and 52 million in the years 2000 and 2010. The region's share of the world total exports would increase to 37% by 2010. The largest exporters in the region are, ranked by volume, Malaysia (18 million m^3), New Zealand (16 million), Australia (8 million), Myanmar (4 million), Papua New Guinea (2.5 million), and China (0.9 million).
The projected direction of trade in industrial roundwood within the Asia-Pacific region and between Asia-Pacific and other countries and territories in 2010 are shown in Table 90. Countries of the Asia-Pacific region are expected to import 100 million m^3 of industrial roundwood, and around 46% will be intra-regional trade and the rest 54% will come from other countries and territories.
Table 90. Direction of trade in industrial roundwood, in thousand m^3, 2010.
Japan will still lead all countries in import in 2010 with 84 million m^3, nearly 43% of which from countries within the region, and 57% from other parts of the world. Figure 20 shows Japanese imports of industrial roundwood from 1962 to 2010. It is expected that Japanese imports will increase 78% from 1992 to 2010, and more than the domestic supply of industrial roundwood. The United States (16.3 million m^3) is likely to continue to be the principal supplier of Japanese wood markets, followed by New Zealand (13.2 million), Malaysia (12.2 million), Chile (10.9 million), Australia (7.7 million), Russia (5.3 million), and Canada (2.2 million).
Figure 20. Japanese imports of industrial roundwood, 1962-2010.
While the Asia-Pacific exports will continue to go to countries in the same region, primarily to Japan, exports to other regions will rise, accounting for 6% by the year 2010. Malaysia is forecast to remain the single largest exporter of industrial roundwood in the region, and New Zealand, Australia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, and even China are all expected to gain in their global market shares.
Sawnwood
Coniferous sawnwood
Non-coniferous sawnwood
Figure 21 shows the Asia-Pacific region and world's consumption of sawnwood and sleepers for the period 1962 to 2010. Over the last three decades, the rate of growth in sawnwood world-wide has been slow partly due to substitution by other wood and non-wood materials. Among the products substituting for sawnwood, especially in developed countries, are wood-based panel products - plywood, particle board and fibreboard, which have grown fast in the last three decades (see Tables 40, 45 and 50).
Figure 21. Sawnwood consumption in the Asia-Pacific region and the world, 1962-2010.
During the next twenty years, global sawnwood consumption should continue to grow, although at a reduced rate. The Asia-Pacific region's consumption of sawnwood is projected to increase from 105 million m^3 in 1992 to 125 million in the year 2010. This is an average annual growth rate of only 1.1%, slower than the last thirty years' average of 3.2%. Hardwood's share should increase from 48% in 1992 to 53% in the year 2010, as a result of increasing non-coniferous sawnwood production and static coniferous sawnwood production. The Asia-Pacific region's share of the world's total consumption is expected to rise from 24% in 1992 to 26% by the year 2010.
The 1992 percentage distribution of the region's consumption is: coniferous sawnwood - 52% and non-coniferous sawnwood - 48%. By the year 2010, this distribution will be reversed to: coniferous sawnwood - 47% and non-coniferous sawnwood - 53% (Figure 21).
The world prices for sawnwood, in 1992 US dollar, are shown in Figure 22. Historically, prices for softwood and hardwood sawnwood have been parallel, with hardwood prices growing slightly faster than softwood prices. This trend is likely to continue over the next two decades. The softwood price is projected to go up from $170 in 1992 to $302 in 2010, while the hardwood price will increase from $362 to $594/m^3[.]
Figure 22. Real world price of sawnwood, 1962-2010.
Although India, China and Indonesia will have sizeable increases in their sawnwood consumption, Japan should still be the leading consumer in the region. As shown in Figure 23, Japan's consumption of sawnwood should continue to grow towards the year 2010, although at a reduced rate compared to the last ten years. The level of consumption is projected to rise from 38 million m^3 in 1992 to 40 million m^3 in 2010.
Japan should remain a net importer of sawnwood, as the projected production would increase from about 28 million m^3 in 1992 to 33 million in 2010 (Figure 23). The imports will account for nearly 20% of Japan's consumption by 2010, drop from 27% in 1992.
Figure 23. Japanese sawnwood production and consumption, 1962-2010.
Coniferous sawnwood
Coniferous sawnwood consumption in the Asia-pacific region is expected to still be 55 million m^3 by the year 2000 and reach 59 million m^3 by the year 2010, up 11 % in 2010 from 1992's level (Table 91). The region's share of the world's total will remain stable, 20% over the same period. By the year 2010, Japan (35 million m^3) and China (13 million) will continue to lead other countries in the region, and the combined consumption of the two countries will account for 81 % of the total coniferous sawnwood consumption in the region, increasing slightly from 80% in 1992.
The softwood share of sawnwood consumption in Japan is expected to remain 87% in 2010. Figure 24 shows the past and future trends in Japanese coniferous sawnwood consumption, which resembles the development of total sawnwood consumption in Figure 23.
Total production of coniferous sawnwood in the Asia-Pacific region is forecast to increase from 46 million m^3 in 1992 to 53 million m^3 in 2010, and meanwhile its world share would increase slightly from 15% to 16% (Table 92). While its production will increase gradually, Japan is expected to remain the largest producer of coniferous sawnwood in the Asia-Pacific, with 28 million m^3 in 2010. Besides Japan, another top producer will be China, with 11 million m^3 in the year 2010.

The Asia-Pacific region's imports are expected to remain the same level between 1992 and 2010. The region's share of the world's total, in turn, would decrease from 17% in 1992 to 13% by the year 2010. The largest importers of softwood lumber in the region in 2010 would be Japan (7 million m^3) and China (1.3 million). The combined imports of the two countries are expected to account for more than 80% of the region's total. Imports of coniferous sawnwood in Australia are expected to fall from over one million m^3 to 0.5 million between 1992 and 2010 (Table 93).
Instead, the region's exports of coniferous sawnwood are expected to grow but remain small level, accounting for 5% of the global exports in 2010. New Zealand will continue to dominate other countries within the region in exports. It is expected that New Zealand's coniferous sawnwood exports will increase from slightly less than 1 million m^3 in 1992 to close to about 1.3 million by the year 2010. Australia will also see rapid increases in coniferous sawnwood exports, but both a smaller base (Tables 94).
Historically, the Asia-Pacific region has been a net importer of coniferous sawnwood, and will continue to be so in the future. By 2010, the major suppliers of the region would be Canada (60 million m^3) and the United States (7.5 million) (Table 95). The only noticeable exporter of coniferous sawnwood in the region is New Zealand, as its exports would amount to nearly 1.3 million m^3 in 2010. About 90% of which would be shipped to other Asia-Pacific countries.

Table 95. Direction of trade in coniferous sawnwood, in thousand m^3, 2010.
Japan should remain the dominant importer among all other countries in the region. Ranked by volume, the main suppliers of softwood lumber to the Japanese market in 2010 should be Canada (4.0 million m^3), the United States (2.0 million), New Zealand (600 thousand), and Russia (200 thousand). The evolution of Japanese softwood lumber imports by major suppliers from 1962 to 2010 are displayed in Figure 25.
Figure 25. Japanese softwood lumber imports from major suppliers, 1962-2010.
By 2010, Canada will supply a 58% of Japan's softwood lumber imports, up from 57% in 1992, while the United States share is expected to rise from 27% in 1992 to 29% in 2010. Such growths could be materialized only if business continued as usual in North America. However, a recent CINTRAFOR (1995) study suggested that continued expansion of lumber exports from North America may be limited by resource constraints and environmental issues in British Columbia and the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Although small, New Zealand is also expected to increase exports of coniferous sawnwood to Japan (Figure 25). But for Chile and Russia, the forecasts imply that the exports would decline gradually. These results agree with the CINTRAFOR study (1995) which suggests that New Zealand and Chile's principal species of softwood lumber, radiata pine, has been mostly used in Japan for lower-valued end uses, such as packaging, and can not be used to substitute Japanese domestic species or Douglas-fir
and western hemlock form North America in the traditional housing market. For Russia, despite its high supply potential, the likelihood of radical expansion in softwood lumber exports to Japan may be reduced by the limited capital investment in production capacity and the inability of Russian woods to substitute for high-quality species used in traditional housing.
Non-coniferous sawnwood
Total consumption of non-coniferous sawnwood in the Asia-Pacific region are projected to increase from 50 million m^3 in 1992 to 58 million in 2000 and 66 million in 2010 (Table 96). This implies an average annual growth of 1.7% between 1992 and 2010, compared to 2.8% from 1972 to 1992. The region's global share is expected to rise from 39% in 1992 to 41 % in the year 2000 and 43 % in 2010.

Consumption will grow between 1992 and 2010 in almost all of the countries or territories in the region. By the year 2010, the leading consumers of hardwood lumber in the region will be India with 19 million m^3, China with 12 million and Indonesia with 11 million.
Figure 26 shows consumption and production of hardwood lumber in Japan from 1962 to 2010. Consumption will drop from the peak of 12 million m^3 in 1973 to 5 million in the year 2010, reflecting the falling supply of tropical hardwoods. Production, however, will increase to 4.6 million m^3 in 2010.
Figure 26. Non-coniferous sawnwood production and consumption in Japan, 1962-2010.
The production of the region is expected to grow from 50 million m^3 in 1992 to 59 million in 2000 and 67 million by the year 2010 (Table 97). The region's world share is also to rise from 39% in 1992 to 42% and 43% in 2000 and 2010. Ranked by 2010 production levels, the major producers of non-coniferous sawnwood will be India with 19 million m^3, Indonesia and Malaysia with 12 and 11 million respectively, and China with nearly 10 million. Of them, India will be self-sufficient in supplying its hardwood lumber market, China will be an importing country, and Indonesia and Malaysia will be main exporters of hardwood sawnwood.
The Asia-Pacific region has been a net exporter of non-coniferous sawnwood. This trend is likely to continue over the next two decades. Tables 98 and 99 summarize the import and export trends for non-coniferous sawnwood world-wide from 1992 to 2010. The Asia-Pacific region's imports are projected to increase 21% from 7 million m^3 in 1992 to 8.6 million in the year 2010, while exports will increase 12% over the same period. The region's share of world imports will rise from 43% in 1992 and 58% in 2010, and the share of world exports is forecast to increase from 53% in 1992 to 61% in 2010.

The leading importers are projected to be Thailand (3.5 million m^3), China (2.3 million), Japan (0.79 million), Singapore (0.74 million), and the Republic of Korea (0.46 million). Of those five countries, Japan, Republic of Korea and Singapore would have a declining trend in imports of hardwood lumber from 1992 to 2010.
The largest exporter will be Malaysia (4.9 million m^3), supplying more than half of the regional total exports, followed by Indonesia (1.8 million) and Singapore (1.0 million). While the exports from Malaysia would decrease slightly, Indonesia's exports of non-coniferous sawnwood would more than double between 1992 and 2010.
Table 100 shows the projected direction of trade in non-coniferous sawnwood in the year 2010. Relative to the 1992's levels (Table 28), exports from Indonesia and Singapore are expected to expand, while those from Malaysia and China would decline. For Malaysia, over 90% of total exports will go to countries within the Asia-Pacific countries, and the leading importers in the year 2010 will be Thailand with 3.5 million m^3, and China with 2.3 million. Outside the region, the European Union will continue to be the largest importer of Asia-Pacific hardwood lumber, and the volumes are expected to increase from about 1.5 million m^3 to 1.8 million between 1992 and 2010.

Table 100. Direction of trade in non-coniferous sawnwood, in thousand m^3, 2010.
Exports of North American hardwood lumber to the Asia-Pacific countries are projected to increase more than 4 times, from 700 thousand m^3 in 1992 to 3.1 million in 2010. The main destinations of the exports will be Japan (180 thousand m^3) and China (646 thousand).
Wood-based Panels
Veneer sheets
Plywood
Particle board
Fibreboard
Wood-based panels have seen the fastest growth, among all forest products, in consumption, production and trade since 1962 in the Asia-Pacific region. This trend will change over the next two decades, as shown in Figure 27. The Asia-Pacific region's wood-based panels consumption is expected to increase nearly 40% between 1992 and 2010, from 29 million m^3 to about 40 million. This is an average growth of 2% per year. Over the same period, the world total consumption of wood-based panels is projected to increase from 121 million m^3 in 1992 to 146 million in the year 2010. Thus, the Asia-Pacific region's share of the world would rise from 24% in 1992 to 27% by the year 2010.
The 1992 distribution of the region's consumption was: veneer sheets - 7%, plywood - 65%, particle board - 15%, and fibreboard - 13%. By the year 2010, this distribution would change slightly: veneer sheets - 7%, plywood - 66%, particle board -14%, and fibreboard - 13% (Figure 27).
The world prices for wood-based panels, in 1992 US dollar, are shown in Figure 28. Historically, prices for veneer sheets and plywood have been parallel and have declined in real terms, while prices of particle board and fibreboard remained fairly constant. This trend is predicted to change over the next two decades, with all panel products prices rising and prices of veneer sheets and plywood growing faster as prices of industrial roundwood increase. Prices of veneer sheets and plywood are projected to increase from $583 to $697 and from $385 to $548, respectively, between 1992 and the year 2010. Prices will also go up from $232 to $304 for particle board and from $301 to $431 for fibreboard.
Although Japan's consumption of wood-based panels is expected to increase from 12.4 million m^3 in 1992 to 14.5 million in the year 2010. China has the potential to replace it as the largest consumer in the region. Consumption of wood-based panels in China is projected to increase 50% from 1992 to 2010, from slightly under 8 million m^3 to more than 12 million. Other countries which will have tremendous increases in consumption include Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Australia, and Thailand.

Figure 28. Real world prices of wood-base panels, 1962-2010.
Veneer sheets
Table 101 shows the forecasts of world-wide veneer sheets consumption to 2010. Consumption of veneer sheets in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to increase from 2 million m^3 in 1992 to 2.4 million in the year 2000 and 2.9 million in 2010. This represents an annual increase of 1.9% between 1992 and 2000 and 1.6% for the 2000-2010 period, down from the 6% growth for the 1982-92 period and much lower than the 87% growth during the period of 1962-92. The Asia-Pacific region's share of the world's total will rise from 36% in 1992 to 38% in the year 2000 and 39% in 2010, reflecting faster growth in consumption than the world average in the next two decades.

Most countries within the region are expected to increase their domestic consumption of veneer sheets over the next twenty years. Among them, Japan, Malaysia and China will remain the top three consumers of veneer sheets. China's consumption is projected to increase from 128 thousand m^3 in 1992 to about 314 thousand in the year 2010. Consumption of veneer sheets in Japan is likely to increase between 1992 and the year 2010, from 989 thousand m^3 to 1.2 million. Similar to China and Japan, Malaysia will also experience a faster growth period, and nearly double its veneer sheets consumption by the year 2010. Besides these three countries, Thailand and Singapore will also be important consumers of veneer sheets in the Asia-Pacific region by the year 2010.
To meet the increasing requirements, the production of veneer sheets in the Asia-Pacific region is projected to rise accordingly, from 1.9 million m^3 in 1992 to 2.1 million in 2000 and 2.2 million in 2010. The region's world share will decrease from 35% in 1992 to 34% in the year 2000 and 30% in 2010 (Table 102).

Among all countries, Malaysia would remain the largest producer of veneer sheets in the region by the year 2010. Japan is expected to be the second largest producer of veneer sheets, and production is forecast to increase from 289 thousand m^3 to 600 thousand in 2010. Over the same period, China will most likely not produce veneer sheets.
Total imports of veneer sheets by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to rise from 954 thousand m^3 in 1992 to 1.0 million in the year 2000 and 1.3 million in 2010 (Table 103). But the expansion of imports would be slower with an average annual growth rate of 1% between 1992 and 2000 and 3% between 2000 and 2010, against 15% from 1982 to 1992. The region's world share will decrease from 42% in 1992 to 39% in 2010. The leading importer will still be Japan with 0.6 million m^3, followed by China with 314 thousand and Thailand with 282 thousand.

As shown in Table 104, exports of veneer sheets by countries in the Asia-pacific region are projected to increase from 2.1 million m^3 in 1992 to 3.3 million in 2010. The region's share of the world total exports would drop from 42% in 1992 to 19% by 2010. The main exporters in the region are Malaysia (511 thousand m^3) and Indonesia (75 thousand).
The direction of trade in veneer sheets in the year 2010 are reported in Table 105. Japan and China would be the main importers, supplied mainly by Malaysia, Indonesia, and the rest of the world.
Table 105. Direction of trade in veneer, in thousand m^3, 2010.
Plywood
Table 106 reports world-wide consumption of plywood from 1992 to 2010. Plywood consumption in the Asia-pacific region is expected to amount to 23 million m^3 by the year 2000 and 27 million by the year 2010, up 19% and 40% respectively from 1992's level. The region's share of the world's total will rise from 40% in 1992 to 42% in the year 2000 and 43 % in 2010.
While consumption is projected to grow in all countries within the region, Japan, China, the Republic of Korea and Indonesia are expected to hold their leading positions of plywood consumption by 2010. The combined consumption of these four countries would account for nearly 90% of the total plywood consumption in the region, the same as in 1992.
China's consumption is projected to almost double between 1992 and 2010, from 4.6 million m^3 to about 7.7 million. Consumption of plywood in Japan is likely to rise 20% over the same period, from 9.2 million m^3 to 11 million. Indonesia, as the largest plywood producer in the region, may see its consumption increase from 1.5 million in 1992 to 2.3 in 2010. Similar to China, Japan and Indonesia, the Republic of Korea will also experience a faster growth in its plywood consumption by the year 2010.

Table 107 shows the production of plywood by country and territory for the period 1992-2010. Coupled with the increases in consumption, production of plywood in the Asia-Pacific region is projected to rise from 23 million m^3 in 1992 to 27 million in the year 2000 and 30 million in 2010. The region's production will represent 50% of the world's total in the year 2000 and 48% in 2010, up slightly from 47% in 1992.
Among all countries, Indonesia and Japan will continue to be the top producers in the region, followed by China which is expected to replace Malaysia as the third largest producer of plywood in the region by the year 2010. Indonesia's production is forecast to grow from 10 million m^3 in 1992 to 12 million by 2010. Japan is expected to improve its self-sufficiency in plywood, and production is forecast to increase from 6 million m^3 to 9 million for the period 1992-2010, and to account for 81% of domestic consumption, up from 65% in 1992. Over the same time, China's plywood production would increase from 2 million m^3 to 2.5 million by the year 2010.
The Asia-Pacific region has been a net exporter of plywood during the last thirty years. This trend is likely to continue over the next two decades. The region's imports are projected to increase 13% from 8.4 million m^3 in 1992 to 9.5 million in the year 2010, while exports will rise only 6% over the same period, due mainly to the accelerating consumption within the region, meanwhile the region's share of world plywood imports is expected to rise from 56% in 1992 and 57% in 2010, and the share of world exports to decline from 79% to 76% between 1992 and 2010 (Tables 108 and 109).

The projected leading importers include China with 5.3 million m^3, Japan with 2.0 million the Republic of Korea with 0.9 million. Of those three countries, Japan and Republic of Korea would experience a declining trend in imports of plywood, mostly hardwood, from 1992 to 2010. Japanese imports would decline by 38%, while those of China are expected to almost double.
Indonesia would continue to be the main exporter with nearly ten million m^3 of plywood exports in the year 2010, which represents about 79% of the region total exports, followed by Malaysia with 1.4 million. The projected increase in exports is 15% for Indonesia and the projected decrease in exports is 16% for Malaysia between 1992 and 2010. The exports from these two countries are expected to account for 90% of the total exports of the Asia-Pacific region.
Table 110 shows the projected direction of trade in plywood in the year 2010. Compared to the 1992 levels (Table 44), Japanese imports of plywood from Indonesia are expected to decrease, while imports of China from Indonesia would increase much. Outside the Asia-Pacific region, the United States and the European Union will continue to be the largest importers of Asia-Pacific plywood, and the volumes are expected to increase from 1.2 million m^3 to 1.9 million for the United States, and decrease from 1.1 million m^3 to 587 thousand for the European Union, between 1992 and 2010.
Exports of North American plywood to the Asia-Pacific region are projected to increase from 96 thousand m^3 in 1992 to 155 thousand in the year 2010. The main destination will be Japan (99 thousand m^3).
Table 110. Direction of trade in plywood, in thousand m^3, 2010.
Particle board
Consumption of particle board in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to increase from 4.5 million m^3 in 1992 to 5.0 million in the year 2000 and 5.4 million in 2010 (Table 111). This represents an annual increase of 2% between 1992 and 2000 and 1% for the 2000-2010 period, down sharply from the 13% growth for the 1982-92, The Asia-Pacific region's share of the world's total will rise from 9% in 1992 to 10% in 2010.
China, Japan and the Republic of Korea will be the top three consumers. China's consumption is projected to increase from 1.4 million m^3 in 1992 to about 1.6 million in the year 2010. Consumption in Japan is likely to decrease slightly between 1992 and 2010, from 1.2 million m^3 to 1.1 million. Australia and the Republic of Korea will experience a faster growth in their particle board consumption by the year 2010.
Production of particle board in most countries is expected to grow in concert with consumption (Table 112). The production of particle board in the Asia-Pacific region is projected to grow from 4.0 million m^3 in 1992 to 4.8 million in the year 2000 and 5.0 million by the year 2010. The region's world share is also to rise from 8% in 1992 to 10% and 9% in 2000 and 2010. Ranked by 2010 production levels, the major producers of particle board will be China with 1.4 million m^3, Japan with 1.0 million and Australia with 0.9 million. Of them, Japan and Australia are expected to be mostly self-sufficient with production-consumption ratios of 94% and 98%, respectively.

The Asia-Pacific region has been a net importer of particle board since the 1980s. This trend is not expected to change over the next two decades. The total imports by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are projected to remain 800 thousand m^3 level between 1992 and 2010 (Table 113), compared to 118% from 1982 to 1992. This is mainly due to increases in domestic production in the region. The world share of the Asia-Pacific will decrease from 15% in 1992 to 13% in 2010. The leading importers will include the Republic of Korea with 370 and China with 241 thousand.

As shown in Table 114, the exports of particle board by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are projected to remain stable from 1992 to 2010. The region's share of the world total exports would hold stable around 6-8% for the same period. The main exporters in the region are Indonesia (214 thousand m^3) and New Zealand (98 thousand).
The directions of trade forecasts for particle board in the year 2010 (Table 115) show the Republic of Korea as main importer of particle board both from the Asia-Pacific region and from other parts of the world, as in 1992 (Table 43). The United States is projected to remain the leading supplier of particle board to the Asia-Pacific markets, with 229 thousand m^3 in the year 2010.

Fibreboard
Forecasts of world-wide fibreboard consumption to the year 2010 are given in Table 116. The Asia-Pacific region's consumption is expected to increase from 3.8 million m^3 in 1992 to 4.1 million in the year 2000 and 5.0 million in 2010. This implies an annual increase of 1.8% between 1992 and 2010, down from 11% between 1982 and 1992. The Asia-Pacific region's share of the world's total will rise from 19% in 1992 to 22% in the year 2000 and 23% in 2010.

China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea are expected to remain the top three consumers of fibreboard. China's consumption is projected to increase from 1.8 million m^3 in 1992 to about 2.6 million in the year 2010. Consumption of fibreboard in Japan is likely to rise from 1.1m^3 to 1.2 million between 1992 and the year 2010. The Republic of Korea will also experience a faster growth of its fibreboard consumption by the year 2010. The combined consumption of those three countries will account for more than 87% of the total regional demand for fibreboard.
Table 117 reports the production of fibreboard by country and territory for the period 1992-2010. For the Asia-Pacific, production is projected to increase from 3.6 million m^3 in 1992 to 4.9 million in 2010. The region's world share will be up moderately from 18% in 1992 to 21% in 2000 and 22% in 2010.
Among all countries, China will lead in fibreboard production over the next two decades, followed by Japan and New Zealand. China is expected to be largely self-sufficient in supply, and production is forecast to increase from 1.5 million m^3 to 2.0 million in 2010. Japan's fibreboard production is likely to increase more than 22%, from 929 thousand m^3 in 1992 to 1.1 million by the year 2010. For New Zealand, the production is expected to reach 0.6 million m^3 by 2010.
The region's imports (Tables 118) are expected to increase between 1992 and 2010, from 722 thousand m^3 to 1 million. The region's share of the world's total, in turn, would decrease from 46% in 1992 to 32% in 2010. The largest importer of fibreboard in the region in 2010 would be China (568 thousand). The imports of China are expected to account for about 56% of the region's total. Other important importers of fibreboard in the region include the Republic of Korea with 96 m^3 thousand, Japan with 79 thousand, Singapore with 77 thousand and Australia with 63 thousand.

The region exports are projected to grow but remain small, accounting for about 27% of the global exports in 2010. New Zealand will continue to be the largest exporters within the region. It is expected that New Zealand's fibreboard exports will increase from slightly less than 360 thousand m^3 in 1992 to 430 thousand by the year 2010 (Table 119). While exports from Australia are likely to more than double from 118 to 304 thousand m^3 in twenty years, Indonesia's exports are expected to increase to 54 thousand m^3 by the year 2010, from almost none in 1992.
The direction of trade in fibreboard in the year 2010 for the major importers and exporters are shown in Table 120. The major suppliers within the region will continue to be New Zealand and Indonesia as mentioned above. The main destinations of the exports from those two countries have been and will still be the countries in the same region. The largest importer for both New Zealand and Indonesia exports is China, with about one-half of the region's total imports of fibreboard from the two countries. Outside the region, United States is expected to continue to be the largest supplier of fibreboard to the Asia-Pacific markets, with 334 thousand m^3 in 2010.

Paper and Paperboard
Newsprint
Printing and writing paper
Other paper and paperboard
The Asia-Pacific region's paper and paperboard consumption is expected to nearly double between 1992 and 2010, from 69 million metric tons to about 128 million (Figure 29). This implies an average annual growth rate of 3.5%. Over the same period, the world total consumption of paper and paperboard is projected to increase from 238 million metric tons in 1992 to 382 million in the year 2010. Thus, the Asia-Pacific region's share of the world total would rise from 29% in 1992 to 33% by the year 2010.
Figure 29. Printing and writing paper consumption in the Asia-Pacific region and the world, 1962-2010.
The 1992 distribution of the region's consumption was: newsprint - 11%, printing and writing paper - 29%, and other paper and paperboard - 60%. By the year 2010, this distribution is forecast to change to: newsprint - 10%, printing and writing paper - 36%, and other paper and paperboard - 54% (Figure 29).
The world prices for paper and paperboard, in 1992 US dollar, are in Figure 30. Historically, prices for newsprint, printing and writing paper, and other paper and paperboard have been parallel. This trend is likely to continue over the next two decades, with all prices changing little from 1992 to 2010. The newsprint price is projected to increase from $577 to $594 per metric ton between 1992 and the year 2010, the price of printing and writing paper from $948 to $932, and that of other paper and paperboard from $833 to $844.
Figure 30. Real world price of paper and paperboard, 1962-2010.
Although China's consumption of paper and paperboard is expected to more than double from 1992 to 2010, Japan should still be the largest consumer in the region. Other countries which will have sizeable increases in consumption include the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, India, Australia, Thailand and Malaysia.
Newsprint
Table 121 shows the projections of world-wide newsprint consumption between 1992 and 2010. Consumption of newsprint in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to increase from 7.6 million metric tons in 1992 to 10 million in the year 2000 and 13 million in 2010. This represents an annual growth of 3.1% between 1992 and 2010 period, similar to 3.7% for the 1982-92 period. The Asia-Pacific region's share of the world's total will increase slightly from 24% in 1992 to 26% in the year 2000 and 28% in 2010.

Among them, Japan and China would be the two largest consumers of newsprint in the region. Consumption in Japan is likely to continue to grow between 1992 and 2010, from 3.7 million metric tons to 5.2 million. China's consumption is projected to more than double from 877 thousand metric tons in 1992 to about 2.0 million in the year 2010. Besides Japan and China, the Republic of Korea, Australia, India, Thailand, and Malaysia are also expected to be important consumers of newsprint in the region by the year 2010. Except Australia, all of them would experience the fastest growth, and more than double their newsprint consumption by the year 2010.
The region's world share of production would stay at about 20% from now to the year 2010 (Table 122). The production of newsprint is projected to increase from 6 million metric tons in 1992 to 7.8 million in the year 2000 and 10 million by the year 2010. One half will be produced in Japan by the year 2010, compared to 54% in 1992. Japan has been in the past and will continue to be the dominant producer of newsprint in the Asia-Pacific, due to its large domestic market. Japanese production would grow faster than its consumption. As a result, Japan is expected to become fully self-sufficient in the future, producing 99.8% of its total domestic consumption by 2010. Ranked by 2010 production levels, other major producers of newsprint are China with 1.5 million metric tons, the Republic of Korea with 1.1 million, Australia with 824 thousand, and India with 542 thousand.

Table 123 shows imports of newsprint by country and territory, between 1992 and 2010. The total imports by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to increase to 3 million metric tons in the year 2010 from 2 million in 1992. But the expansion of imports would be slower with an average annual growth rate of 3.5% between 1992 and 2000 and 1.6% between 2000 and 2010, compared to 4% from 1982 to 1992. The region's world share of imports would, however, rise from 18% in 1992 to around 27% in 2010. China would replace Japan to become the largest importer in the Asia-Pacific region, with imports doubling from 277 thousand metric tons in 1992 to 572 thousand in 2010. Japan's imports are projected to fall from 544 to 218 thousand metric tons between 1992 and 2010. Like China, Malaysia would also experience a fast growth in newsprint consumption, more than doubling it between 1992 and 2010.
As shown in Table 124, the exports of newsprint by countries in the Asia-pacific region are projected to slightly increase from 485 thousand metric tons in 1992 to 611 thousand in the year 2010. The region's share of the world total exports would remain insignificant at about 4-5%. The main exporters in 2010 would be Japan (209 thousand m^3) and New Zealand (184 thousand).

The directions of trade world-wide in newsprint in the year 2010 are reported in Table 125. China would be the main importer of newsprint both from the Asia-Pacific region and from other parts of the world. Japan is expected to surpass New Zealand to become the largest exporter of newsprint within the region. The main importer for Japan's exports would be China, while it is forecast that Australia would import mainly from New Zealand in 2010. Canada is expected to maintain its dominant position of newsprint exporter to the Asia-Pacific region with 879 thousand metric tons, followed by the United States exporting 758 thousand and the European Union exporting 661 thousand. The imports from Asia-Pacific countries are expected to account for only 15% of total imports in 2010, down from 17% in 1992.
Table 125. Direction of trade in newsprint, in thousand metric tons, 2010.
Printing and writing paper
Consumption of printing and writing paper in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to increase from 20 million metric tons in 1992 to 33 million in 2000 and 46 million in 2010 (Table 126). This represents an annual increase of 6.1% between 1992 and 2000 and 3.2% from 2000 to 2010, down from 15% growth between 1982 and 1992. The Asia-Pacific region's share of the world's total will rise from 29% in 1992 to 33% in 2000 and 36% in 2010.
While consumption is projected to increase in all countries within the region, Japan and China will continue to be the main consumers of printing and writing paper by 2010. China's consumption is projected to more than double between 1992 and 2010, from 5.9 million metric tons to about 15.0 million, while consumption of printing and writing paper in Japan is likely to double over the same period, from 9.4 million metric tons to 18.8 million. The combined consumption of the two countries would account for more than 70 % of the total printing and writing paper consumption in the region from 1992 to 2010.
By 2010, other important consumers of printing and writing paper in the region would be the Republic of Korea (2.7 million metric tons), Indonesia (1.8), India (1.6) and Australia (1.5). Of them, Indonesia and the Republic of Korea would experience a much faster growth, and more than double their printing and writing paper consumption by the year 2010.

Total production of the Asia-Pacific region is forecast to more than double and amount to 44 million metric tons in 2010 (Table 127) so that the region would be about 96% self-sufficient, compared to 94% in 1992. Japan with 20 million metric tons and China with 14 million would be the largest producers in the region by 2010. While China would reach a self-sufficiency of nearly 95%, Japan is expected to remain a net exporter. There are two other countries with production exceeding 1.5 million metric tons. The Republic of Korea and Indonesia are projected to more than double their production of printing and writing paper. The production in the top four producing countries is expected to be 90% of the region's total, remaining the same level in 1992.
The Asia-Pacific region has been a net importer of printing and writing paper in the last thirty years. This trend is not expected to change over the next two decades. The total imports by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are projected to increase from 2 million metric tons in 1992 to 3 million in the year 2000 and 4 million in 2010 (Table 128). But the expansion of imports would be slower with an average annual growth rate of 5% between 1992 and 2000 and 3% between 2000 and 2010, compared to 15% from 1982 to 1992. This is mainly due to a strong increase of production within the region. The world share of the Asia-Pacific imports would rise significantly from 11% in 1992 to 29% in 2000 and 37% in 2010. The leading importers would include Hong Kong with 804 thousand metric tons, China with 741 thousand and Singapore with 705 thousand.

As shown in Table 129, the exports of printing and writing paper by countries in the Asia-Pacific region are projected to nearly triple between 1992 and 2010, from 848 thousand metric tons to 2.4 million. The region's share of the world total exports would increase from 10% to 20% over the same period. The dominant exporter in the region would still be Japan exporting some 1.6 million metric tons of printing and writing paper in the year 2010. That is expected to account for about 68% of the Asia-Pacific region's total exports. The forecasts show that Hong Kong would also export a significant volume of printing and writing paper. Since Hong Kong does not have any production of printing and writing paper, they are expected to be transit exports from Japan (Table 130).

The directions of trade in printing and writing paper in the year 2010 (Table 130) show Hong Kong as the main importer of printing and writing paper from the Asia-Pacific region, mostly from Japan, as in 1992 (Table 68). By 2010, Hong Kong would import 804 thousand metric tons of printing and writing paper. Nearly half of that amount is expected to be re-exported to other countries. On the other hand, China and Australia has been and would continue to be the main importers of printing and writing paper from other parts of the world, mostly from the European Union.
Japan is expected to be the region major supplier, with about 75% of its exports heading to countries within the Asia-Pacific. Outside the region, the European Union is projected to remain the leading supplier of printing and writing paper to Asia-Pacific markets, although the quantities traded may decrease slightly by 2010. The United States is also projected to decrease its exports of printing and writing paper to the region by 30%.
Table 130. Direction of trade in printing and writing paper, in thousand metric tons, 2010.
Other paper and paperboard
Table 131 shows world-wide consumption of other paper and paperboard from 1992 to 2010. Consumption in the Asia-pacific region is expected to amount to 55 million metric tons by the year 2000 and 69 million by the year 2010, 34% and 71% more than in 1992. The region's share of world rise from 30% in 1992 to 31% in 2000 and 34% in 2010.

China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are expected to continue to be the main consumers other paper and paperboard by 2010. China's consumption is projected to nearly double between 1992 and 2010, from 15 million metric tons to about 27 million. Consumption of other paper and paperboard in Japan is likely to rise 49 % over the same period, from 15 million metric tons to about 23 million. Similarly, the Republic of Korea will also experience a fast growth period, and nearly double its consumption of other paper and paperboard by the year 2010. Figure 31 shows the consumption of other paper and paperboard in the Asia-Pacific region from 1962 to 2010. While China's share of the regional consumption is expected to increase from 37% to 39%, that of Japan would decline from 37% to 33% between 1992 and 2010. There are six other countries with consumption exceeding 1 million tons in 2010: Indonesia (2.3), Australia (1.7), India (1.3), Hong Kong (1.2), Malaysia (1.1) and Thailand
Figure 31. Consumption of other paper and paperboard in the Asia-Pacific region, 1962-2010.
Production of other paper and paperboard in the Asia-Pacific region is projected to rise from 39 million metric tons in 1992 to 50 million in the year 2000 and 63 million in 2010. The region's production will represent 29% of the world's total in the year 2000 and 30% in 2010, up a little from 27% in 1992 (Table 132).
Japan, China and the Republic of Korea are expected to be the largest producers. By the year 2010, Japan will still be the leading producer in the region. China's production is forecast to nearly double from 14 million metric tons in 1992 to 24 million by the year 2010. During the same period, other paper and paperboard production in Japan would rise from about 16 million metric tons to 24 million, and Japan would continue to be self-sufficient, meanwhile, the Republic of Korea's production is projected to increase from 3.9 million metric tons to 6.7 million.

The Asia-Pacific region has been a net importer of other paper and paperboard for the last thirty years. This trend is expected to continue during the next two decades. Tables 133 and 134 summarize the world-wide import and export trends. The Asia-Pacific region's imports are projected to increase 50%, from 6.4 million metric tons in 1992 to 9.6 million in the year 2010, while exports would decline from 3.9 to 3.2 million metric tons, due mainly to the accelerating consumption within the region, meanwhile the region's share of world's total imports of other paper and paperboard is expected to fluctuate between 36% and 44%, and the share of world's total exports to decline markedly from 22% to 14%. The projected leading importers in 2010 include China with 3.7 million metric tons and Hong Kong with 1.4 million.
Japan is forecast to continue to be the largest exporter with nearly 1.8 million metric tons of other paper and paperboard exports in 2010, about 58% of the regional total exports. Exports of China and Hong Kong are expected to decrease as domestic consumption increases.

Table 135 shows the projected direction of trade in other paper and paperboard world-wide in the year 2010. Compared to the 1992 levels (Table 79), Hong Kong's imports from China are expected to decline from 305 to 120 thousand metric tons, while imports from Japan would more than double. China's imports from Japan are projected to rise markedly from 144 to 350 thousand metric tons. Imports of the Republic of Korea are also expected to more than double. These three countries or territories would remain the top three importers of other paper and paperboard from Japan. In contrast, Asia-Pacific countries' imports from China would decline gradually over the next two decades.
Table 135. Direction of trade in other paper and paperboard, in thousand metric tons, 2010.
Outside the Asia-Pacific region, the United States and the European Union will continue to be the largest importers of other paper and paperboard from Japan. Exports of the United States to the Asia-Pacific countries are projected to almost double, from 1.7 million metric tons in 1992 to 2.8 million in the year 2010, while the European Union's exports would grow by 70%. The main destinations would be China, Hong Kong and Indonesia. The Asia-Pacific countries' imports from other regions are projected to account for about 84% of their total imports.
Comparison with the Recent FAO World Outlook for Forest Products
A recent alternative set of projections for countries and territories of the Asia-Pacific region is available in the recent Outlook for Global Forest Products Consumption, Production and Trade prepared for the FAO by Zhang et al. (1996). The present Asia-Pacific study was completed before the Global Outlook, with a similar methodology but with different assumptions, and a different model structure. The main difference is in the base year, 1992 for the Asia-Pacific study, and 1994 for the Global Outlook. Also, in terms of results, the model for the Global Outlook did not project the direction of trade between countries and territories.
After the Global Outlook was completed, the projections for the Asia-Pacific were re-done so that they would use similar assumptions regarding projected economic growth, and projected supply potential in each country and territory. Specifically, the assumptions of the Asia-Pacific study are similar to those of scenario 2 in the Global Outlook. Therefore, the two sets of forecasts are not independent. Nevertheless, there are differences between the two sets of forecasts. The main reason for the differences is the different base years.
For comparison, Table 136 shows the projected consumption to 2010 of the main product aggregates by country and territory, for the two studies. For the entire Asia-pacific region, consumption of fuelwood and charcoal is 10% lower in this study than in the lowest projection of the Global Outlook. For industrial roundwood, consumption in 2010 is 3.6% higher in this study than the highest projection of the Outlook. Sawnwood consumption is near the median projection of the Outlook. For wood-based panels, projected consumption is 19% lower than the lowest projection of the Outlook. And, the projected consumption of paper and paperboard is 11% lower in this study than the lowest projection of the Outlook.
Relative differences are sometimes larger for individual countries, most of the differences are attributable to the choice of the base year. For example, for China, paper and paperboard consumption in 1992 was estimated to be 22.1 million tons in 1992, and 29.8 million tons in 1994. Still, the projections of these two studies are both much lower than earlier projections (FAO 1991, 1994, 1995). The reason lies in part in the lower rates of economic growth assumed both in this study and in the Global Outlook, and in changes in methodology (Zhang and Buongiorno 1994).
It is believed that to get the best possible projections, the technical procedures on which this study relied must be supplemented by expert opinions concerning the situation in various countries and territories. Still, whatever adjustments are made to the forecasts, if they are integrated in the methodology used here, then the equilibrium calculation guarantees full consistency of forecasts of consumption, production, trade, and prices, within the Asia-Pacific and between the Asia-Pacific and the rest of the world.
