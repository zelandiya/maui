<title>Asia-Pacific Forestry Sector Outlook Study: Forest Resources and Roundwood Supply in the Asia Pacific Countries: Situation and Outlook to the Year 2010</title>
<section>1</section>
INFORMATION NOTE ON ASIA-PACIFIC FORESTRY SECTOR OUTLOOK STUDY
At its sixteenth session held in Yangon, Myanmar, in January 1996, the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission, which has membership open to all governments in the Asia-Pacific region, decided to carry out an outlook study for forestry with horizon year 2010. The study is being coordinated by FAO through its regional office in Bangkok and its Headquarters in Rome, but is being implemented in close partnership with governments, many of which have nominated national focal points.
The scope of the study is to look at the main external and sectoral developments in policies, programmes and institutions that will affect the forestry sector and to assess from this the likely direction of its evolution and to present its likely situation in 2010. The study involves assessment of current status but also of trends from the past and the main forces which are shaping those trends and then builds on this to explore future prospects.
Working papers have been contributed or commissioned on a wide range of topics. They fall under the following categories: country profiles, selected in-depth country or sub-regional studies and thematic studies. Working papers are prepared by individual authors or groups of authors on their own professional responsibility; therefore, the opinions expressed in them do not necessarily reflect the views of their employers, the governments of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission or of the Food and Agriculture Organization. In preparing the substantive report to be presented at the next session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission early in 1998, material from these working papers will be an important element but will be blended and interpreted alongside a lot of other material.
Working papers are being produced and issued as they arrive. Some effort at uniformity of presentation is being attempted but the contents are only minimally edited for style or clarity. FAO welcomes from readers any information which they feel would be useful to the study on the subject of any of the working papers or on any other subject that has importance for the Asia-Pacific forestry sector.

1. INTRODUCTION
The main objectives of the working paper are:
 to present the current situation and the possible evolution of the forest resources in the Asia Pacific region.
 to propose an outlook of the roundwood supply in the Asia Pacific region to the year 2010.
To achieve these objectives, the study focused on the assessment of the current situation, trends and likely developments of the forest resources. Forest areas, growing stocks, increments and fellings have been reviewed on a country basis. Key driving forces of forestry sector development such as policy changes have been assessed to develop a likely quantitative forest scenario for the year 2010.
Roundwood supply has been analysed from two points of view: - roundwood production potential (increment) as the total estimated capacity to produce roundwood; and roundwood felling (removal) as the total roundwood harvested. Considering the impact of changes in the agricultural frontier and the population growth, the working paper has attempted to assess the potential productive capacity and fellings for both fuelwood and industrial wood uses.
The focus on wood production given in the working paper does not imply lower importance to other forest products or functions. These other functions are dealt with by other papers under the Asia Pacific forestry sector outlook study.

2. METHODOLOGY
2.1 The approach
2.2 The structure of the study
2.3 The model
2.4 The Projection
2.1 The approach
The approach of the study has been developed through three main steps:
 standardisation of the forest resources information in such a way that comparisons of areas and roundwood supply between countries and sub-regions are possible;
 derivation of the present situation of forest resources and roundwood supply in the different countries forming the region;
 development of a realistic scenario which describes the likely size, state and composition of the Asia Pacific forestry resource and of supply by 2010.
The country forest resources situation has been derived from the most reliable and up-to-date information on the state of forests and forestry available at FAO Headquarters. To provide "the most probable" situation by the year 2010, a model has been developed which works on a spreadsheet (Excel). The design of the model has been kept user friendly and simple. Formulas - standardised for all countries - are linear and mainly based on common sense; it is felt that in the absence of solid information, use of complex models might suggest greater knowledge than currently exists. The scenario mechanism is a tool to show signals based on possible forecasts for forest resources and wood supply under various assumptions. Under the study assumptions, users may modify any given parameters and build up their own image of the expected future situation; in this way, the implications of possible interventions or policies can be tested before decisions are taken.
It should be stressed that the aim has been to derive orders of magnitude. Greater precision would require more accurate information than many of the countries in the region are able to provide at present.
2.2 The structure of the study
For the purpose of the study, the Asia-Pacific region will extend from Pakistan in the west to the International Date Line in the east; from Mongolia, China and Japan in the north, to include the Pacific Islands until Australia and New Zealand inclusive in the south. It will not include the Russian Far East or any of the Americas.
For the study, a total of 24 countries (or group of islands) have been analysed and the Asia Pacific region has been sub-divided into the following five geographic sub-regions:
 North Asia: China, Japan, Korea (Rep.), Korea (Dem.), Mongolia;
 Oceania-Pacific: Papua New Guinea, Melanesia, Polynesia, New Zealand, Australia;
 Insular Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines;
 Continental South-East Asia: Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam;
 South Asia: Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh.
Sub-regions and countries are classified in decreasing order of forest and wooded land areas as in 1990. Each country has been studied individually; summation of country data was used to obtain the sub-regional and regional estimates of the forest resources status and the roundwood supply (potential and fellings). Islands of the Pacific have been grouped into Melanesia and Polynesia Islands.
2.3 The model
2.3.1 Assumptions
2.3.2 The parameters
To present the situation of the forest resources and roundwood supply in each country and to work out a possible scenario showing the likely evolution up to the year 2010, a model has been developed. The model runs by 5 year periods with a set of formulas and parameters for which definitions are detailed in Section 3.
Some prerequisite assumptions have been made and are related to wood production, felling and growth. Assumptions and parameters needed to establish the forest resources status and to develop the base scenario are given below.
2.3.1 Assumptions
Wood production
The study considers that wood production originates from three main sources:
 production forests: comprise all natural exploitable forests and plantation forests.
 other forests and wooded lands: low productive, poor, open forests or forests partially or totally protected. These forests contribute to the wood supply of the local population (but this contribution is often unrecorded). Wood destruction due to fires and other natural disasters is not considered in the study.
 non forested lands: are all but forested areas. Commercial tree crops (mainly rubber and coconut) in some countries and arable lands produce significant amounts of wood. Rangelands, barren and rocky lands, deserts are considered as wood un-productive areas.
Wood fellings
The study considers that:
 Fellings of industrial roundwood: originate only from the production forests and that the industrial roundwood supply is commercialised in the formal sector.
 Fuelwood and other local timber fellings are directly linked to the estimated wood consumption of the population.
Wood Growth
Considering the short period of the outlook (20 years), wood stock estimates per hectare and annual increment parameters are kept unchanged during the whole scenario period (1990-2010). Wood production changes are linked mainly with forest area changes.
2.3.2 The parameters
The forest resources parameters
The data base line of the forest resources situation is generally 1990. However, data are called parameters as many are standardised or estimated. The parameters needed to feed the model for each country are as follow:
 The area (in ha):
* total country area;
* total forest and wooded land;
* natural exploitable forests
* plantation forests (man-made forests);
* forest conservation area;
* low productive/open forests
* arable lands;
* commercial tree crops (rubber, coconuts);
* other/range/barren lands.
 The commercial growing stock (in m^3/ha) related to:
* natural exploitable forests;
* plantation forests (man-made forests).
 The mean annual increment (in m^3/year/ha) related to:
* natural exploitable forests;
* plantation forests (man-made forests);
* low productive and open forests;
* commercial tree crops (rubber, coconuts);
* trees growing on arable lands.
 Fellings (in m^3/year) expressed as:
* Industrial roundwood removals (m^3/year);
* Fuelwood fellings (m^3/inh/year).
The parameters influencing projected situation
The future evolution of forest resources and wood supply will depend upon the changes in the following main parameters:
 the deforestation factor - (% of loss of natural exploitable forests and other forests and wooded lands area per year);
 the plantation forests programme (thousands ha per year);
 the removals of industrial roundwood - (thousands m^3/year).
 the conservation areas (totally protected);
 the commercial tree crop;
 the range conversion factor is the estimated percentage of the deforested lands turned into range lands;
 the increase of other/range/barren lands in relation to lands made available from deforestation.
The definitions of these parameters are given in section 3.
2.4 The Projection
2.4.1 Information sources
2.4.2 Country profiles and sub-regional analysis
Only one projection, considered a likely trajectory, has been developed which provides in 5-year periods up to the year 2010 a possible outlook on the following:
 the forested areas in terms of productive and non productive zones being natural or planted forests;
 the commercial growing stock from natural and planted forests;
 the annual roundwood felling broken down into industrial roundwood and fuelwood;
 the annual wood production potential (increment) of roundwood broken down by sources (production forests, other forests, non forested lands).
2.4.1 Information sources
Information related to country forest resources has been collected at FAO headquarters principally from published and raw information under the Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) programme. The first draft of the study containing the FAO information and the consequent scenario was sent to the countries through the outlook study focal points for comments and validation. Relevant notes and remarks have therefore been integrated. The revised projection for forest resources and roundwood supply are considered by the author to be the most likely. This procedure replaces the possibility of first obtaining first hand figures from the countries themselves through questionnaires.
The information related to national forest areas is mainly based on the Forest Resources Assessment 1990 - FAO Forestry paper 112, 124, 127. Arable land areas are from FAO Production Yearbook 1994. Information related to exploitable natural forest and plantation forests areas are from country sources collected at FAO and the same source is used for the FAO - GFSS (Global Fibre Supply Study); however, some figures provided were adapted in accordance with the specific study definitions. Figures related to wood growth - growing stock and increment - do not often exist at national level and are extrapolated from similar situations.
Figures related to industrial wood removals are taken from country documents or recent reliable studies. Fuelwood production figures are from the FAO Yearbook of Forest Products and from the Review of Wood Energy Data in member countries of the Regional Wood Energy Development Project (RWEDP) (March 1997).
Table I.2 provides the summary of the values given to each parameter for each country.
2.4.2 Country profiles and sub-regional analysis
For each country, a forest resources profile has been developed. Each profile contains the following analysis: (a) the country's forest situation: describes the state of the forest (tropical or temperate), forest distribution, main problems, management level with logging intensity, plantation forests programme, rural forestry, conservation forest activity; (b) Forestry sector development: gives a short analysis of the present forest policy, strategy and legal framework related to forest development; and (c) "projected development": explains the reasoning and level of the parameters used to build up the base scenario. Some comments on the results are provided.
The countries are grouped as outlined earlier and country base scenarios are aggregated into sub-regional scenarios. A short analysis accompanies each respective sub-regional scenario. This analysis discusses three points: (1) the overall sub-regional forest resources status; (2) the sub-regional sectoral perspectives; and (3) wood production potential and fellings in the sub-region. Countries composing the sub-regions are compared from the point of view of forest resources areas, annual roundwood fellings and increment.
The 24 country profiles and their projections and the 5 sub-regional analyses are given in Part II.

3. DEFINITION OF THE PARAMETERS AND FORMULAS USED IN THE WOOD SUPPLY PROJECTION
3.1 Forest resources parameters
3.2 Projection parameters
3.3 The supply projection
3.1 Forest resources parameters
The proposed definitions are consistent with the definition used in the FAO Global Fibre Supply Study (GFSS). Country forest resources figures are those of 1990. Production parameters are put all together in Table 8.
The areas (in ha):
 Total country land: total country land area excluding inland water. Figures are provided from FRA - 90 (Global synthesis - FAO Forestry Paper No. 124) and the FAO Yearbook of Forest Products.
 Forest and other wooded lands (FOWL): include all types of forested areas being forests or wooded lands (see definition below). Figures are standardized and taken from FRA-90 (Global synthesis - no 124) and considered as a point of reference for all countries. FOWL are formed of:
 Forests: are ecological systems with a minimum crown coverage of land surface (here assumed as 10%) ^1 and generally associated with wild flora, fauna and natural soil conditions. It is worthwhile pointing out that the definition used in the study has a minimum vegetation cover requirement and is often quite different from a legal definition of forest (such as in a Forest Act or Ordinance).
^1 FAO - Forest Resources Assessment - guidelines for Assessment 1990.
 Wooded lands: include forest fallow and shrubs. Forest fallow refers to all complexes of woody vegetation deriving from the clearing of natural forest for shifting cultivation. Forest fallow is an intermediate class between forest and non forest land uses. Shrubs refer to vegetation types where the dominant woody elements are shrubs with more than 50 cm and less than 5 meters height on maturity.
 Natural exploitable forests: refer to natural or semi-natural forests composed of tree species known to be indigenous to the area. It includes bamboo forests. Natural exploitable forest (or commercial forests) means productive and economically accessible forests. It is the area available for timber wood supply. Forest areas having economic restrictions (environmental, health, access constraints) or legally protected (and having significant impact on wood supply) are not included. Figures are often based on information provided by Master plans, articles or documents from national forestry administrations or ministries and are in accordance with GFSS data.
 Plantation forests (or man-made forests): are forests established by afforestation or reforestation. Plantation forests include all types of forest tree plantations whether industrial, communal or individual covering at least an area of about half hectare. Trees on road side, canal banks and homesteads are not included; also rubber, coconut and oil-palm are excluded.
 Low productive/open forest areas: are all forests being considered as poorly stocked or partially exploited. This category of forests includes open forests, totally or partially protected forests and forested conservation areas. Protected forests of watersheds are included. That area is calculated and is the result of the difference between the total forest and wooded land and the natural exploitable forests plus plantation forests.
 Conservation areas: consist of national parks, reserves and protected natural areas which fall under IUCN categories. Figures are provided by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC) ^2. As it is presently not yet possible to separate forest areas from barren and other lands inside conservation areas, conservation figures are given for information. Conservation areas are included in the low productive/open forests areas and have no immediate implication on total forest area calculation.
^2 See document APFSOS/WP/04 prepared by WCMC for this outlook study.
 Arable lands: refers to arable land under temporary crops, homestead gardens (agro and urban forestry), and land temporarily fallow or lying idle (recent slash and burned areas). Range lands are not included in arable lands as it is assumed that range lands provide no or very limited wood supply. Arable lands may include trees on roads side and canal banks.
 Commercial tree crop lands: refers to land cultivated with tree crops that occupy the land for long periods. Commercial crop area is mainly related to rubber and coconut plantations that have an significant impact on wood production in some countries.
 Other/range/barren lands: are areas that do not contribute to wood supply. That means barren lands such as rocky lands and deserts. Range lands are included. Area figure is obtained by deducting forest and arable lands from the total land area.
Commercial Growing Stock (CGS)
The Commercial Growing Stock (CGS) means the volume that may actually be cut and removed from the natural exploitable forests and plantations forests. This volume of wood may include wood for industrial purposes (e.g. sawlogs, veneer logs, etc.) and for local domestic use (poles for construction). Use of wood for fuelwood is not included in this category.
 CGS natural forest (in m^3/ha): is the estimated over bark volume of all actually commercialised trees (over 10 cm diameter at breast height) living on one hectare in the natural exploitable forests. In tropical forests, only a small part of the total growing stock can be effectively used for commercial purposes. Figures on commercial growing stock in natural exploitable forests are often estimated or extrapolated from similar situations.
 CGS plantations (in m^3/ha): is the estimated over bark volume of all trees (over 10 cm at breast height) growing on one hectare of tree plantation. As almost no average figures exist (except for some countries, but to what extent are they valid?), the commercial growing stock is difficult to appraise as plantations are a mix of mature and young (in majority) stands with the age distribution not known.
Mean Annual Increment (MAI)
The MAI (Mean Annual Increment) is the volume of wood growing on one hectare of forest during one year (m^3/ha/year) on average since the forest has been established. For a tree plantation, the MAI is the present total growing stock volume of one hectare divided by the total age. The total age of the natural forest is not known. In this study, MAI is related to the CGS.
 MAI natural exploitable forests (m^3/ha/year): is the mean annual increment (per ha) of the commercial species growing stock in natural and semi-natural forests. Generally no precise figures are available, only guesstimates exist. Recent studies show that MAI of natural exploitable forest is very low and sometimes negative due to natural death. Figures used fall between 0 to 2 m^3/ha/year.
 MAI plantations (m^3/ha/year): is the mean annual increment (per ha) of forest plantations. Good estimates exist in various situations. Plantations may include fast growing trees as well as low growing trees. Used figures are in the range 2-18 m^3/ha/year depending on species, age and reported growth.
 MAI other forests (m^3/ha/year): is the mean annual increment (per ha) of wood stock growing in all forests areas which are not classified as production forests such as low productive, protected and open forests. Figures are guesstimates. However, it is certain that large areas of low productive/open forests produce significant amounts of fuelwood and other products. A coefficient ranging from 0 to 1.5 m^3/ha/year is used at least to show that these areas have some production potential which has to be taken into account.
 MAI commercial crop plantation (m^3/ha/year): is the mean annual increment (per ha) of wood produced mainly from rubber and coconuts plantations. Good estimates exist in some countries. These estimates have been extrapolated and proposed figures range from 0 to 3.5 m^3/ha/year.
 MAI arable lands (m^3/ha/year): is the mean annual increment (per ha) of wood stock produced from agricultural lands including homestead production. Homestead production has been studied in various situations although national average figures are not precise. Average production is proposed between 1 and 2 m^3/ha/year.
Fellings
Felling is the volume felled during a given period whether or not removed from forest or other felling sites; that includes silvicultural and pre-commercial thinnings and cleaning left in the forest. Normally volume is over bark. Removal is only what is exported from the forest and corresponds to fellings less harvesting residues.
 Industrial roundwood (m^3/year): include all industrial wood in the rough (logs, sawlogs and veneerlogs, pulpwood and chips, poles, piling, pitprops, match blocks, etc...) but no fuelwood. Official figures are generally available.
 Waste and residues (%): represents the felling residuals which are left in the forest after felling and not salvaged. This is a coefficient (%) attached to the industrial roundwood supply and should give the quantity of wood wasted during the harvesting operations. This coefficient varies according to the quality of forest logging and management methods. The coefficient may vary from 10 to 50%.
 Fuel and other wood consumption (m^3/inh/year): is the wood in the rough to be used as fuel for cooking, heating and energy production. Other wood includes a certain amount of local timber (poles, piling and posts) which is not recorded in the formal sector but is used by farmers and rural communities. Figures are based on the population's consumption estimate (per inhabitant).
Population
 Population (inh): the total inhabitants living in the country in 1990. Estimations are from the UN document - "World Population prospects: the 1994 revision". The medium variant has been used.
 Population increase (% per year): is the annual increment (in percentage) of the country population. Estimates and forecasts up to the year 2010 are taken from FRA - 90 or from UN - "World Population prospects: the 1994 revision" in the median variant tables.
3.2 Projection parameters
The likely development of forest resources and wood supply by 2010 is shown by five year period. It is based on the following parameters or assumptions:
 deforestation factor (%): is the annual deforestation percentage on FOWL provided by FRA 90 and related to the country. It applies to natural exploitable forests and to low productive/open forests and is constant for the whole period. The deforestation factor varies from 0 to 2.5% per year. Assumption is made that deforested lands are turned into arable land (keeping some potential for wood production) and rangelands (see range conversion factor).
 Plantation forests programme (ha per year): is a prevision for the annual planting programme for man-made forests. Estimates are based on the country planning objectives and the country capacity to realise the programme. The prevision is constant for the whole period except for some specific cases where prevision is done by five year period.
 removals - industrial roundwood (in m^3/year): is an annual estimate of the domestic industrial roundwood supply. Figures are generally from country official sources. A constant waste and residues coefficient is applied to get fellings estimates.
 conservation area (in ha): shows the possible increase of the total protected areas.
 commercial tree crops (in ha): gives the possible evolution of the area under rubber, coconut crops which could produce wood as raw material.
 Range lands conversion factor (%) is the estimated percentage of deforested lands converted into cultivated lands. Deforested lands are not always turned into arable and cultivated lands but part of them are turned into rang and barren lands. Assumption is made that range lands do not produce significant amount of wood.
 other/range/barren lands area (in ha): shows the increase of area of the non wood producing land area under the assumed percentage of range conversion factor.
3.3 The supply projection
Formulas
The column 1990 uses the forest resources parameters when applicable. For each five year period, the following formulas have been applied:
Production forests
Area total = natural exploitable forests + plantation forests
 Natural exploitable forests = exploit. for. - 5 years x (exploit. for. x deforestation factor).
 Tree plantations = tree plantations + 5 years x annual tree planting programme.
Commercial Growing stock (CGS)
a) for 1990 = baseline information = CGS nat. exploit. forest + CGS plantation forests.
b) For 1991 - to date = CGS nat. exploit. forests + CGS plantation forests + 5 years x (SI total - fellings total) of the preceding period.
 Nat. exploit. forests = nat. exploit. forest area x CGS/ha for nat. exploit. forest.
 Plantation forests
a) for 1990 = baseline information = plantation forests area x CGS/ha plantation forest
b) for 1991 - to date = CGS of the former period + 5 years stock increase (plantation forest area x MAI/ha/year).
Annual wood Stock Increment (SI), {Total SI = SI natural forest + SI plantations}.
 SI - Natural exploitable forest = nat. exploit. forest area x MAI natural exploitable forest.
 SI - Plantations = plantation forests areas x MAI plantation forests.
Fellings industrial roundwood, total = ind. roundwood removals + waste and residues.
 Industrial roundwood removals = see projection parameters.
 Waste and residues = industrial roundwood removals x percentage of waste and residues.
Other forests and wooded lands
Conservation areas = see scenario parameters
Low productive/open forests = low prod./open forests area - 5 years x (low prod./open for. x deforestation factor).
Wood stock increment (SI), total = low productive/open forests area x MAI (other forests).
Non forest lands
Commercial tree crop lands = see scenario parameter.
Arable lands = total country land - total forest and wooded lands - other/range/barren lands - commercial tree crops lands.
Wood stock increment (SI), total = commercial tree crops lands area x MAI (commercial tree crops) + arable lands area x MAI (arable lands).
Fellings fuelwood, total = fuelwood consumption per inhabitant x country population + 5 years x (total fuelwood consumption x percentage annual population increase).
Results
- Wood Stock Increment (SI), all sources: is the Total Annual Increment of wood produced from all productive areas: production forests, other forests and wooded lands and non forest lands.
= SI production forests + SI other forests and wooded lands + SI non forests lands.
- Felling, all sources: is the total volume of all trees that are felled either for industrial or fuelwood purposes.
= industrial roundwood fellings + fuelwood fellings.
- Total forest and wooded lands: is the evolution of the total forested area taking into account deforestation effects and plantations programmes.
= total production forests area + low productive/open forests.
- Percentage of total land: gives the possible evolution of the proportion of land covered with forests and wooded lands.
= total forests and wooded lands area/total land area x 100.

4. RESULTS: FOREST RESOURCES SITUATION AND ROUNDWOOD SUPPLY IN ASIA PACIFIC REGION
4.1 Forests and wooded lands in land use
4.2 Roundwood production potential
4.3 Roundwood fellings
4.4 Comparison between wood production potential and fellings: Industrial roundwood, fuelwood and total roundwood supply (SI = wood stock increment)
Table 1 provides the overall regional picture of forest resources and roundwood supply from 1990 up to 2010. Forest resources areas and roundwood supply are broken down by forest land use category: - production forests including natural exploitable forests and plantation forests; - other forests and wooded lands including low productive and open forests; - non forest lands including commercial tree crops and arable lands.
The 1995 status and the likely development up to 2010 are analysed below regarding the following aspects: (a) the forests and wooded lands in land use; (b) roundwood production potential (and growing stock); (c) roundwood fellings; and (d) comparison between roundwood production potential and roundwood (industrial, fuel and total) fellings.
4.1 Forests and wooded lands in land use
4.1.1 1995 status
4.1.2 Projected 2010 situation
4.1.1 1995 status
About 28 % of the total land area of the whole Asia Pacific region is covered with forests and wooded lands of which 31% are natural exploitable forests, 6% plantation forests and 61% are classified as low productive and open forests (Figure 1; Table 1).
The distribution by sub-regions of the forests and wooded lands is as followed: 10% in South Asia, 14% in Continental S.E., 21% in Insular Asia, 25% in Oceania and Pacific, and 28% in North Asia. South-Asia and Continental South-East Asia are relatively poor in terms of forest cover.
Regarding the exploitable forests, the distribution is somewhat different: 11% in South Asia, 15% in Continental S.E., 32% in Insular Asia, only 10% in Oceania-Pacific, and 31% in North Asia. Insular Asia is the most wealthy sub-region with natural exploitable forests.
Non forest lands (arable and commercial crops) contribute significantly to roundwood supply. About 15% of the total land area of the AP region are arable lands and tree commercial crop lands; these are equivalent to about 50% of the forests and wooded lands area. Trees on arable lands play a particularly important role in sub-regions where forested areas are relatively limited such as in South Asia.
Figure 1 - Comparative resource endowment of sub-regions (1995)
4.1.2 Projected 2010 situation
As a continuation of present trends, the total forests and wooded lands areas would continue to decline progressively and about 30 million ha of forests and wooded lands (3.7% of the 1995 area) should be lost between 1995 and 2010. The loss would be particularly significant in Continental SE Asia (10%) and Insular Asia (12%) (Table 1).
While the natural exploitable forests area would decline by 8.3% for the whole region by 2010, the plantation forests area would increase by 39% during the period considered. Plantation forests would represent in area about 24 % of the production forests (forests for industrial purposes). Expected plantation forests programmes would reach around 500,000 ha/year in North Asia, 275,000 ha/year in South Asia and Insular Asia and about 150,000 ha/year in Oceania Pacific and Continental South-East Asia.
The low productive and open forests area is expected to decrease by 6% as deforestation continues. The commercial crop area would not increase significantly during the period and its contribution to the overall regional scenario would remain relatively limited. Arable land area would increase by about 2.7% from the deforested areas.
4.2 Roundwood production potential
4.2.1 1995 status
4.2.2 Projected 2010 situation
4.2.1 1995 status
The roundwood production potential is expressed by the annual wood stock increment (SI) and is generated from the three land categories: - the production forests generate 51 % of the total SI; - the other forests and wooded lands generate 13%; - and the non forest lands 36% of the utilizable wood stock increment. Industrial roundwood production potential is issued from natural exploitable forest (42%) and from plantation forests (58%). Fuelwood and other (un-commercialised) forest products are from low productive forests and open forests 27% and from other forest lands - arable and commercial crop areas - 73%. Although the low productive and open forests cover more than 61% of the forests and wooded lands, the contribution to wood production potential is relatively limited (13%) (Figure 2).
Figure 2 - Production potential in 1995
4.2.2 Projected 2010 situation
In accordance with the hypothesis to keep constant the mean annual wood increment (MAI), the evolution of wood production potential will follow closely the changes of the land uses. Total wood stock increment (production potential - SI) in the AP region would grow by 11% during the period 1995-2010 due mainly to the increasing contribution of the plantation forests and trees growing on arable lands. The annual wood stock increment of the natural exploitable forests and low productive and open forests would decrease in proportion to the area loss and the relatively low level of MAI.
The commercial growing stock (CGS) of the natural exploitable forests would decrease by 7% but the CGS of the plantation forests would increase by 31%. Total CGS of the production forests in AP region would increase by about 2%.
4.3 Roundwood fellings
4.3.1 1995 situation
4.3.2 Projected 2010 situation
4.3.1 1995 situation
Total roundwood felling is shared between industrial roundwood felling (33%) and fuelwood felling (67%). However, the picture is quite different in the sub-regions: North Asia and Oceania Pacific subregions are felling annually more industrial wood than fuelwood; on the contrary, the other three subregions and particularly South Asia are supplying annually more fuelwood than industrial wood.
Figure 3 - Wood fellings in 1995
4.3.2 Projected 2010 situation
Fellings of industrial roundwood will increase by 23% during the period. Fuelwood fellings (which may include un-commercialised local timber) will increase by 34% and are in direct relation to the population increase. Fuelwood supply (and demand) is very sensitive to people's habits. A small change in consumption at family level could have great impact on fuelwood supply.
Arable lands have large potential for wood production particularly in South Asia countries. Continued improvement of MAI rates on arable lands could significantly increase the total roundwood production potential.
4.4 Comparison between wood production potential and fellings: Industrial roundwood, fuelwood and total roundwood supply (SI = wood stock increment)
By 2010, total fellings of industrial roundwood (Figure 8) will increase by 16% but the corresponding wood production potential (SI) would increase faster (20%) showing at regional level a positive SI/felling ratio (1.5). This observation is valid for all sub-regions but is hiding divergences at country level. For example China would have a deficit in industrial roundwood supply which is covered by the excess of production potential (in industrial roundwood) of the other countries (Japan, Korea) belonging to the same sub-region.
Fuelwood felling (Figure 9) for the whole AP region would be far higher than the possible potential wood increment. All sub-regions are in deficit except for Oceania and Pacific region. Although in 1995 the regional ratio SI/felling was 0.7, it is expected that this ratio would fall down to 0.58 by 2010.
Regarding the total roundwood supply (Figure 10), the regional ratio SI/felling is going down from 0.96 (1995) down to 0,88 (2010) showing an growing deficit in total roundwood production. The gap is widening due to the rapid increase of fuelwood fellings and the population increase. The Oceania Pacific sub-region is the only one showing a positive balance SI/felling. South Asia and Continental Asia started with a positive balance in 1990 but should know a deficit situation by 2010.

Countries: China, Japan, Mongolia, Korea (Rep.), Korea (DPR).
The forest resources
China dominates the north Asia sub-region as its territory covers more than 80 % of the total considered area. The major part of North Asia is under cold temperate climate and subtropical conditions are only found in south China and Japan. Most of the commercial forests are coniferous and located in remote mountainous areas. Japan and both Koreas are well endowed with forest cover. Forests in China and Mongolia are unevenly distributed and cover less than 20% of the national land. Economic policies and past wars have had disastrous effects on natural forests stands. Forests have been over-exploited and shifting cultivation still occurs in less developed areas. However, China has embarked in on-going large programmes of tree farm planting and shelterbelts. In Japan and Korea Rep., poor natural forest lands were converted into productive man-made forests during the past 30 years. Present growing stock is generally low because many natural forests stands have not yet recovered
and are still young. Wood growth in Mongolia is very slow due to difficult climatic conditions. The sub-region is prone to natural disasters such floods, storms and fires.
Forest ownership is mainly private in Japan and Korea Rep. However, the ownership pattern in the former communist regime countries is changing rapidly. Long term lease of forests and lands are being allowed for forest logging and planting. Natural forest management is improving with better control on harvesting operations and shifting cultivation. Total forest and wooded land area should increase slightly in the sub-region during the period. That increase will be the direct consequence of the high rate of tree plantations in China and of the efforts to keep down the deforestation rate. Tree plantation area will increase by 35% during the period while the natural forest area will decrease by 5%.
Sector development perspectives
Policy reforms in the forestry sec have been implemented at different period in the countries forming the sub-region. Japan and Korea Rep. should benefit soon from their efforts and domestic supply should increase by 2010. Korea DPR. still has to shift its present forest policy from centrally planned system to meet the forest management standards for sustainable development.
Japan could probably have benefited earlier but domestic wood harvest is not promoted due to policies to rely on wood import for domestic supply and due to lack of incentives to improve silvicultural operations. Despite lay tree plantation programmes and strong policy measures such as promotion of wood substitutes, China will not be self-sufficient in supply within the next twenty years. Harsh climate conditions and new environmental policy will favour forest conservation in Mongolia.
Wood production and fellings
The sub-region is short of industrial roundwood. All countries are compelled to import wood products to meet the increasing demand for industrial wood products, the volumes being small only in Mongolia. Japan particularly has a long tradition of wood use for houses construction and paper consumption. China and Korea Rep. are undergoing rapid economic expansion. Present wood stock and growth cannot cope with the demand for industrial roundwood. Industrial roundwood felling is still higher than the net annual increment. Tree plantations are still young and not yet productive to counterbalance wood import. Although the annual temperature is relatively cold, fuelwood production is somewhat low due to the efforts to reduce wood consumption like in China or related to the economic development like in Japan. Only in China, the total fellings (including industrial roundwood and fuelwood) are higher than the total annual increment but their effects influence the sub-region picture.
In the sub-region, the SI/felling ratio will remain stable but in deficit indicating that a gap between wood production and wood supply. China accounts for 85% of the 2010 felling of the sub-region. In the other countries of the sub-region, the domestic wood production will increase less than the fellings and therefore the relative SI/felling ratio will diminish increasing accordingly the global percentage of wood deficit. Wood production from plantations will increase and represent about 83% of the total industrial roundwood production.

CHINA
The forest resources
China's forests and wooded lands cover only 18% of the total land. Forests are unevenly distributed and mainly found in three major areas (in the Northeast, Southwest and South); the natural forest resources are often located in remote areas and mountain ranges. Coniferous type forests (pine, larch, spruce, fir) represent about half of the total forest area, broadleaf forests either temperate (paulownia, poplar) or tropical (mahogany) are the other half. Forests in China have gone through a long degradation process caused by over exploitation, mismanagement and conversion into agriculture. Therefore, mature and productive natural forest areas have dropped significantly and the quality of the stands is presently generally low. Lack of data series and reliable information makes it difficult to understand the past evolution of forests. Accessible mixed-coniferous forests in the north have been heavily logged and 75% (in area) and 45% (in growing stock) of the timber forests are
reported as young or middle-aged stands.
Population pressure, rapid modernisation of the country's infrastructure are creating an unprecedented demand for all natural resources and wood supply cannot cope with the present requirements. The highly uneven distribution of remaining forests and the inadequate transportation capacities are aggravating regional shortages. All mature forests continue to be in the state ownership and managed through a network of forest bureau. After a long period of state monopoly, presently about 60% of the forested lands are either managed by households with contractual arrangements or are directly owned by peasant families. All arable land including land for tree crops is allocated to households for a period of fifty years. Communal forests and waste lands are contracted to individuals for management.
Erosion problems are dramatic; floods and windstorms are devastating on the plains and the Loess plateau. For the rural population (67%), the main economic activity is related to subsistence agriculture. Tree crops often play an important role for cash income.
Since 1950, the country has been engaged in a tremendous effort in revegetation. At the beginning, mass tree planting campaigns and compulsory afforestation programmes were credited with unprecedented tree plantations achievements; however, the emphasis on quantity requested by the centrally planned system was not matched by quality. Privatisation transformed most of the Chinese countryside and new plantings are reportedly relatively more successful. Farmlands and pasture lands are protected by shelterbelts. Afforestation projects and massive shelterbelts programmes are presently being designed and implemented under privatised contract management. But prolonged droughts, extensive pest and fire damage are reducing the tree plantation impacts and production expectations.
China is listed as one of the mega-diversity countries in the world as it contains full ranges of major habitats from the permafrost regions in the Northeast to the humid tropical climates in the South. About 5.3% of the total land area has been classified as natural reserves to protect biodiversity.
Forestry sector development
China started reforms a long time ago; in 1979 new policies introduced a rural responsibility system for natural resources management. In 1985, a new Forestry Law and a set of managing regulations was promulgated providing guidance to the private sector for sector development. Due to the heterogeneity and size of the country, forestry development will be implemented and expanded progressively at district level. A planning process (NFAP) has been carried out so far in the Simoa district (Province of Yunan) as a first experimental exercise.
As the wood shortfall is unlikely to be made up rapidly by new plantation production, strict measures have been taken to curb tree felling including widespread campaigns for the use of coal instead of fuelwood and for the use of substitute materials in place of wood in construction. China's planners have set self-sufficiency in roundwood supply to the year 2040.
Projected development
The annual felling is significantly in excess of increment and this situation should remain for some time although China is making strong efforts to limit forest degradation and wood consumption. Based on various sources of information, the increase of industrial roundwood removals is estimated at 1% per year. The deficit between wood supply and consumption would be met through wood imports for industrial forest products including roundwood (or substitute) and by forest stock depletion for fuelwood or use of non-wood biomass fields. China is a leader in biogass use and also has coal as a substitute. Fuelwood consumption is assumed to be low as wood supply is very scarce in populated areas. Due to the poor quality of early tree plantations, their contribution to wood supply will be relatively low.
China will continue to invest in its forestry sector development mainly through large scheme plantations. Less expensive operations like better management of the productive but also the so-called unproductive forests could be promoted to release the present tight situation. However, China faces major structural constraints for sector development such as inefficient technologies, technical staff availability, low degree of commercialisation of forests products and poor economy. As suggested by the Chinese planners, despite all efforts more time is needed to improve the present situation.

JAPAN
The forest resources
Japan's forest cover is more than 67% of the national land area. However, the per capita forest area is just about 0.2 ha (world average 0.8 ha). Climate in Japan varies from temperate cold in the North to sub-tropical in the South. 70% of Japan is mountainous and most of the mountains are under forests. Natural forests count for about 55% of the forested land and are made up especially of broad-leaved trees like Fagus spp, and Quercus spp. Mature forests are found in remote areas which are largely designated as protected forests. Low productive natural forests have been converted into man-made forests (45% of the forested land). Most species of man-made forests are coniferous trees such as Cryptomeria, Chamaecyparis, Larix and Pinus spp. Reforestation programmes were promoted after the World War II following large scale disasters occurring in river basins due to deforestation and due to widespread shortage of timber. These programmes were implemented under profit sharing
contracts with forest owners. About 58% of the forests belong to individuals, corporations, temples, local authorities. The remainder 42% are national forests and put under the jurisdiction of the governmental Forest Agency. The majority of natural and man-made stands are about 30 to 50 years old.
Presently, the share of the domestic wood in the total supply of wood is only 25%. Large amount of wood imports, increasing cost of logging and transportation, tree diseases and low level of domestic prices are adding negative effects for adequate forest management and development. Moreover, mountainous areas have experienced rapid depopulation. Although the growing stock is rising with the maturing of post-war plantations, much of the forest resource is neglected and private and national forests are deteriorating through lack of effective management.
Non wood forest products and charcoal production are important income sources for forests owners and these products are recognised as one of the driving forces for rural development in mountainous areas. The public has recently shown growing interest in forests and demand for preservation of natural forests has been rising. As of 1991, a conservation forests system including 779 areas and covering about 358,000 ha has been established while an aggregate of 8,9 million ha of forests are under protection.
Forestry sector development
The former forest planning system, strongly oriented towards timber production, was reviewed in 1991 and the new Forest Law gives more emphasis to forest protection by introducing the River Basin Management System. 60% of the forests are kept under some protection status. The declining profitability of forestry in recent years has discouraged forest owners from undertaking forestry operations such as thinning and even the state forestry agency know funding problems as many national forests are declared as nonproductive. Small and scattered units of production and distribution are increasing the cost of locally processed wood although domestic wood demand for houses construction is still expanding. Policy actions are taken presently to enhance interest in forestry and wood industries and to promote activities in upstream villages to ensure sound management.
Projected development
Natural forests conversion into highly productive man-made forests will continue steadily. The increasing protection status of the forests and the abandonment of remote villages will not favour the adequate management of both natural and planted forests. While potential domestic wood supply is increasing; industrial roundwood fellings will remain constant up to the year 2000 when it is assumed that local harvesting will increase significantly. Forest policy in Japan is directly dependent from the international wood market and supply. Unexpected shortage of wood or the emergence of new competitors in the international market could have major impacts on wood import prices and quantities. The growing stock, considered as a strategic wood reserve for Japan, will reach upper level particularly in planted forests. SI/felling ratio will remain highly positive during the considered period.

MONGOLIA
The forest resources
Mongolia is a vast and very sparsely populated territory. The total forest cover is about 10% and the major part of the land area consists of steppes in the broad central belt which has little to no forest cover. The high altitude (1600 m on average) and the relatively high latitude exacerbate the semi-arid continental climate resulting in long cold winters. The mean temperature is below the freezing point during about seven to nine months in a year. The country is divided into three main topographical zones: the mountains located in the north and west, the river basin where the major farming regions are located and the steppes which cover three-fourths of the national territory. About 70% of the forest resources are found in the northern part of the country. Larch, cedar, pine (Pinus sibirica), birch, fir, aspen are the main species. Excessive past exploitation practices of natural forests have caused major environmental degradation. Forest management is based on a long
cutting cycle (more than 100 years). Much of the commercial forests are located on steep slopes and difficult to access. Wood waste is high, potential markets are at great distance and road connections are poor. A large portion of the forests is regularly damaged by wild fires. Until 1990, all land and the associated resources were the property of the state. From 1993, under the new constitution and the draft Land Law, private ownership of land (lease of forest lands) has been possible.
About 80% of the country land is suitable for extensive animal husbandry (cattle, horses, camel, goats, sheep). Intensive crop cultivation is limited by the short growing season. The forests are closely integrated with pasture land and the forest role is important in relation to soil protection, shelterbelts for hay-making, construction material for cattle barns, fodder and fuelwood. Due to the severe weather conditions and livestock, reforestation activities are difficult although it is reported that larger areas of forest lands need to be reforested or improved.
About 50% of the forests in Mongolia are strictly protected to limit soil erosion and exploitation is only allowed to meet local needs. Mongolia has a long tradition in nature conservation and a network of special forests including national conservation parks and nature reserves has been established.
Forestry sector development
Since 1990, the country's economy has undergone a major structural transformation moving form a centrally planned economy to a free market economic system based on policies of privatisation. All laws and regulations, the organisational structure and the financing system related to forestry have to be adapted to economic goals. All production units of forest industry have been privatised. A new forest Law in compliance with the law on Environmental Protection was adopted in March 1995. This aims to regulate the protection of the forests and enhance forest regeneration. Forest sector development is being geared toward the sustainable management of the resources. Forestry conditions are peculiar due to the adverse climate conditions, fragile soils, low density of the population and low ratio of forested area. The key elements of the strategy for development will be forest resources protection, sustainable utilisation of forests and generation of financing resources through
licence fees and royalties, privatisation of State interest and research.
Projected development
Although protection laws will help to control and hopefully slowdown the level of forest damage (over-exploitation and fires), the forest area in Mongolia will slowly decrease mainly as a consequence of overgrazing. Due to the inaccessibility of the productive forests, and the present conservation measures, forest harvest will decrease progressively down to an estimated sustainable level of production. Forest are in Mongolia should remain unchanged in the near future. Protection laws will help control and hopefully slow down the level of forest damage (over-exploitation and fires). MAI figures are low due to climatic conditions. Forest management will slowly improve as new economic rules are progressively integrated. Forestry development could be impeded by lack of financial and human resources.

KOREA (DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF)
Recent information related to the North Korean forestry sector is rather limited. Some estimates are based on comparison with neighbouring countries.
The forest resources
Mountains and valleys characterize most of the People's Republic of Korea. Forests occupy about 75% of the land area. The climate is cool and continental. Forests remain important as a source of fuelwood. The major part of the forests is coniferous. The principal species are Pinus densiflora, Quercus mongolica and Larix olgensis. Average standing volume is reportedly very low due to past over-exploitation. Shifting cultivation was practised until very recently. Planted tree species are mainly Larix sp., Pinus koraiensis and Pinus rigida. All forest lands belong to the State.
Forestry sector development
Forest law reflects land nationalisation. Forest-related legislation as well as the forest administration in the country have developed in the context of a centrally planned economy. Forest policy is oriented towards timber production. Three institutions are responsible for the management of the forests: the Land Administration General Bureau in charge of the plantation forests programmes; the Ministry of Forestry responsible for the natural forest management; and the Academy of Sciences responsible for forestry research.
Projected development
Forest sector development in DPR Korea is relatively limited as the economic perspectives are relatively poor. Deforestation rates and the fuelwood supply consumption will remain relatively high due to population increase and the large forested area. Forest area will decrease significantly. The ratio between Wood Stock Increment and fellings will remain positive during the considered period thanks to plantations production. Felling of industrial roundwood will increase in line with the expected country economic development.

KOREA (REPUBLIC OF)
The forest resources
The Republic of Korea's forest cover is about 67%. However, the per capita forest area is relatively low at 0.12 ha. The climate can be classified as temperate and the topography where forests are located is often mountainous. Forests are largely coniferous (45%). The main forest tree species are Pine (Pinus koraiensis, P. Densiflora, P. Thunbergi), Larch, Oak, Fir, Birch and Poplar. Most of the forests are privately owned (71%); the remainder belongs to public bodies (8%) or the State (21% - National forests). Many privately owned forests are small with nearly 90% of them being less than 5 hectares. Forests were heavily degraded during the wars in the 1950s. Some deforestation continues because of reclamation and urban development. The growing stock in natural forests is still low and young. Due to the poor forest condition, large afforestation programmes have been carried out during the past two decades and about 30% of the total forest lands have been covered with
man-made forests through pan-national community forestry programmes at village level. Fires and diseases are significant problems. Some of the main problems of forest management are low prices for domestic timber, poor implementation of silvicultural works, shortage of labour, waste of thinning products and inadequacy of forest roads.
The Republic of Korea has for long been short of domestic wood supply. Presently the domestic timber supply is about 20 % of the total demand and large amounts of timber are imported to face the rapid economic development of the country. Some non wood forest products like chestnuts, pine mushrooms are significant and even feature among export commodities.
The Republic of Korea has raised people's awareness about forest conservation and protection and 46 natural recreation forest zones have been established. Private owners are subsidised to develop their forests for recreation purposes, an increasingly important forest function due to growing prosperity.
Forestry sector development
In 1994, the Forest Law was revised to adapt legislation and forestry to the new criteria for sustainable forest management; accordingly, a new forest policy was formulated in 1995. Low output and growing stock of the young forests would be insufficient to meet domestic timber demand for the near future. The general objectives of the past forest plans were to return devastated forests to the status of closed forests through strict protection. Presently, more emphasis is geared to raising income from utilisation of sustainably managed forest resources. Lack of suitable lands and incentives will slow down the planned man-made forests programmes. Some measures like building a network of forests roads, research to utilise small logs, development of forest owners associations to modernise forest operations and technical and financial assistance to forest owners should accelerate Korean forestry development. Korea is also investing in plantations abroad, particularly in tropical
Asia and the Pacific, as a way to secure future supplies.
Projected development
Open forests in the Republic of Korea will decrease slightly due to the pressure of human settlements. The exploitable natural forests area will remain constant and limited tree planting will be done on unproductive open forest areas. Total forest and wooded land should remain stable. The growing stock will remain relatively low but should increase steadily due to the effects of the past protection and plantation measures. Industrial roundwood fellings will be far less than the net annual increment although some felling increase is expected at the beginning of the next century; the forests have still to mature and the country will anyway not meet the high timber demand. Wood production outside productive forests is relatively limited due to the type of agriculture used in rice production countries. Fuelwood and local timber supply are mainly from productive forests. Unexpectedly, the SI/felling ratio will continue to be positive and consequently, the growing stock will
increase. However, the SI/felling ratio will decline as forests mature and domestic wood supply increases.

OCEANIA PACIFIC - SUB-REGIONAL STATUS AND PROJECTION ANALYSIS
AUSTRALIA
PAPUA NEW GUINEA
NEW ZEALAND
MELANESIA ISLANDS
POLYNESIA ISLANDS
Countries: Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Melanesia Islands, Polynesia Islands.
The forest resources
The Oceania Pacific sub-region has two distinct zones: the tropical developing countries consisting of Papua New Guinea and the Oceania and Pacific groups of small islands; and the temperate and developed zone consisting of New Zealand and Australia. Australia has the largest forest resources (about 75%) in the sub-region.
In the tropical zone, Papua New Guinea has the largest area with natural forest followed by Melanesia Islands. The natural forests are often located in mountain areas where access for both logging and agriculture is difficult so that natural forests are somewhat protected. Almost all forested land is owned by clan groups under customary law. Sustainable management practices are not applied. Under population pressure, natural forests areas are converted into agriculture; coconut is the major commercial crop of the sub-region. Major storms and cyclones may damage tree plantations which are actively developed in places where wood supply is expected to be scarce (Fiji is a prime example of this).
In the temperate zone, the natural forest is practically all under protection status and wood supply already comes largely from tree plantations. New Zealand and Australia are embarked in active reforestation programmes.
Total forest and wooded land of the sub-region should decrease during the next 15 years. However, tree plantations development and the strong protection of the natural forest in Australia and New Zealand mask deforestation problems in the small island countries and in Papua New Guinea.
Forestry sector development
Countries are concerned about their natural forests conservation although some developing countries have to meet the basic needs of their growing population in terms of agricultural products and fuelwood. Tree plantations are actively created to support wood based industries. In many countries, laws and regulations were recently reviewed and updated; the main problems of the sub-region relate to the implementation of the new forests policies, land availability for tree plantations and the financing of the protection of the natural forests.
Wood production and fellings
For the whole sub-region, the net annual increment exceeds total felling. Wood stock increment (SI) from natural forest will remain constant. Timber supply from commercial tree crops is relatively limited due to the reported lack of proper utilisation of that potential. However, total fellings should increase by about 32% in 2010 and wood production will increase by about the same percentage. The ratio SI/fellings would remain largely positive. However, Papua New Guinea and Polynesia have a deficit in the ratio SI/felling. The deficit ratio will be stable for Polynesia but will increase for Papua New Guinea by the year 2010. This deficit ratio increase in PNG is explained factors like limited plantation programmes, deforestation, stagnation of wood production and local consumption augmentation.
Fuelwood supply in the sub-region represents only 20% of the total roundwood supply. This figure will remain stable during the considered period. Industrial roundwood production will increasingly come from tree plantations: 60% in 1990 and 72% in 2010.
In terms of roundwood supply, New Zealand will at 38% be close to Australia by the year 2010 (regional share 41%) and Papua New Guinea will play a minor role in the sub-region in that respect. Although the sub-region is well endowed with natural forest cover, the bulk of industrial wood supply is increasingly coming from tree plantations.

AUSTRALIA
The forest resources
The Australian continent covers a land area of 7.68 million km^2. A large portion of the country, however, particularly the interior, is arid or desert land though there is still a huge potentially usable land area. Australia's open and closed forests cover only 6% of the land area, but are still sufficiently extensive to give Australia the largest forest resource in the South Pacific. An additional 14% of the land area is classified as woodlands. The vast majority of the Australian forest resource is natural forest, dominated by eucalypts, with the balance being a made up of Acacia spp, cypress pine (Callitris spp.), paperbarks (Melaleuca spp.), and tropical rainforest. Natural forests comprise 99.3% of the forest resource. The remaining forest (1.1 million hectares) is in plantations. Of this, 73% is softwood (mainly radiata pine) and 26% is native hardwoods although government policy aims to accelerate planting to treble the plantation estate by 2020. Plantations are
being established at a current rate of around 80,000 hectares per year. Australia also plans to encourage tree planting on farmlands (i.e. outside forests).
Around 19% of forest land is reserved for conservation purposes in National parks and reserves. The remainder is in state forests (25%), private forests (40%) and other Government lands (16%). The state forest resource is generally of considerably higher quality than the private resource and around 60% of the state resource is available and accessible for harvest within a multiple use framework which takes into account social values of forests as well as economic values. Forests contribute to tourism and recreation. They also provide fuelwood and a range of non-wood forest products.
Forestry Sector Development
The broad thrust of forest policy in Australia is summarised in the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) (1992). The overriding theme of the NFPS is the ecologically sustainable management of Australia's forests. More recently, a supplementary policy, proposing the establishment of Regional Forest Agreements has been announced. These Agreements are designed to reconcile the inherent conflict between conservation and industrial development aspirations in forestry. The Agreements will provide for comprehensive regional resource assessments to strike a long-term (20 year) regionally (sub-national) based balance between conservation and development objectives. This is likely to see a well balanced approach to sustainable forestry management with probably moderate increases in the conservation estate likely.
Australia's major challenges are in accessing investment capital to maintain competitiveness, resolving industry-environmental tensions and restructuring the government-industry interface particularly as it relates to wood supplies. Australia is expected to become a net exporter of forestry products some time during the next 15 years with the majority of production being increasingly plantation-grown.
Projected development
Australia, with a substantial plantation estate, is expected to manage its natural forests in a sustainable manner for the foreseeable future. The maturing plantation estate should enable Australia to expand wood production to a point of net wood self sufficiency and export by 2010. Plantation establishment will continue at a rate enabling further harvest increases in the long run.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA
The forest resources
Forests in Papua New Guinea cover about 80% of the total land area. However, because of the mountainous topography and the large size of the country, only a small part of the forest area is accessible. The climate is mainly maritime tropical but is strongly influenced by the Australian continent. Various climatic and soil conditions have favoured the development of a rich and heterogeneous forest biodiversity. Many vegetation types such as savannah vegetation, tropical hardwood (Pometia and Calophyllum species), montane forests with Araucaria species can be found. As a consequence, about 70 forest tree species are regularly marketed.
Virtually all forested land is owned by clan groups under customary law. To issue logging permits, the State has to negotiate the timber rights with local authorities. So far, harvesting is repeatedly done as a "mining" operation. A high level of controversy and conflict between conservationists, government and industry has potential to paralyse sector development. Shifting cultivation and forest conversion for agriculture development around populated areas are common. In these conditions, sustainable forest management is obviously difficult. The forestry sector plays an important role in the subsistence economy of the rural/forest population. It is a major source of food and fuelwood. Coconut is important as tree crop.
Relatively small but significant areas of forest tree plantations owned by the State or private companies are found in several localities and supply plywood or chipwood mills. In terms of forest conservation, only few areas are officially declared as protected.
Forestry Sector Development
Since 1990, many changes have been introduced in the forest sector. This has led to the enactment of a new Forestry Act, 1991. This Act has been amended twice (1993 and 1996), the main amendment has been on the composition of the National Forest Board. As a requirement of the Forestry Act, 1991 (as amended), a National Forest Plan was approved in 1996. A Papua New Guinea Logging Code of Practice was also approved in 1996. The Plan and the Code are both now under implementation. The new National Forest Service under the Papua New Guinea Authority has been in operation since 1993. Forest management of the natural forest is under the Forest Management Agreement concept where customary resource owners transfer their timber rights to the Forest Authority which manages the timber resources on their behalf.
Projected development
Although major improvements were introduced recently in forestry sector management, new regulations and policies will take some time to be implemented. Lack of knowledge of the forest resources, insufficient manpower, shortage of funds and political unrest can slow down the momentum for development of this controversial sector. Agriculture and population development will exert considerable pressure on the large forest resource. Deforestation and forest depletion could be high locally but is likely to be modest at national level. Stock increment/felling ratio is in deficit.

NEW ZEALAND
The forest resources
The total land area of New Zealand is about 27 million hectares. The country is formed around several central high mountain chains from which alluvial flood plains have formed. The climate is generally maritime but subject to extremes in weather conditions.
The closed natural forests, a significant proportion of which are virgin forests, cover 24% of the land with plantation forests covering a further 5% of land. The natural forests can be broadly divided into two main types; the beech forests, dominated the four indigenous species of Nothofagus; or the conifer-hardwood forests dominated mainly by Podocarpus species. Around 95% of the natural forests are protected in National parks, scenic reserves, forest parks and other protected areas. These forests are a focus for tourism and recreation.
The plantation forest resource is overwhelmingly dominated by radiata pine. Of the 1.5 million hectares of planted forests, 90% is radiata pine. Total roundwood removals from New Zealand forests in 1996 were 17 million cubic metres with 99% being sourced from the planted forests. Intensive tending regimes are the norm in the planted forests. More than 60% of the resource planted since 1970 has been pruned and this proportion will increase as recent plantings reach a pruneable age. An important wood resource, additional to the planted forests, are wind shelterbelts. In New Zealand these probably total several hundred thousand kilometres in length.
Non-wood forest products tend to be collected mainly on a commercial basis because the majority of natural forests are protected from all forms of unlicensed exploitation while the planted forests are often not open to the public. Wood is also used extensively for fuel both for domestic and industrial purposes.
Forestry Sector Development
The most far-reaching forestry policy of the past decade in New Zealand has been the privatisation policy which has affected forestry, just like other sectors. Since 1987 Government has shed ownership of more than 40% of New Zealand's planted forest resource, selling much of the estate into the hands of overseas interests. The planted forests are almost entirely privatised and the industry operates under essentially free-market policies. The major part of the planted resource is owned by seven major corporates while the remaining (about 30%) is owned by small scale companies, local government bodies and thousands of farmers. An increasing amount of new planting is being undertaken by small scale forest owners and new investors. Privatisation has also reinforced a general acceptance that commercial utilisation of planted forests, by substituting for natural forest exploitation, is a method of conservation.
In New Zealand, two pieces of legislation, the Resource Management Act (RMA) 1991 and the 1993 Amendments to the 1949 Forests Act contain the central legal thrust toward sustainable forest management. The RMA establishes a national framework for the management of natural resources in a way which provides for social, economic, and cultural well being while sustaining the potential to meet reasonable foreseeable needs of future generations and avoiding or mitigating any adverse effects on the environment. The Forests Act defines and implements additional sustainable management criteria for New Zealand's indigenous forest land.
The major difficulties for the sector are in developing processing industries which are internationally competitive and thereby enable domestic maximisation of the economic benefits of the planted forests. The major difficulty in terms of the natural forests is ensuring sufficient funds are available to ensure their effective management in the absence of revenue from commercial harvesting.
Projected development
It is unlikely that there will be enormous changes in landuse proportions over the next 15 years. Planted forests are likely to continue to expand with planted forests probably covering around 7% of New Zealand's land area by 2010. Roundwood removals will accelerate significantly in line with a maturing planted forest resource. Natural forest areas will generally remain static with harvesting remaining at negligible levels.

MELANESIA ISLANDS
The forest resources
The Melanesia islands referred to here are Solomon Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu and the French territory of New Caledonia. Natural conditions are very similar for all islands. The climate is maritime tropical. Cyclones severely and regularly damage crops and plantations. The islands generally comprise a narrow coastal strip rising to steep mountainous country. Highlands are heavily forested and indigenous forest is largely tropical moist forest. However, the leeward side of islands is often covered by grass and savannah (Melaleuca sp.) in accordance with the rainfall level. Natural forest generally belongs to communities (customary ownership) and the rights for timber harvesting must be negotiated with the traditional local authorities. Despite the extensive forest cover, a very large proportion of the forests are presently non-commercial given the steepness and inaccessibility of location. Although population numbers are not very high, pressure on forest is significant and
results in conversion of natural forest to agriculture and range land. Coconut plantations are significant but getting old (and coconut wood is little used).
Plantation programmes are presently mainly export oriented (chipwood from pine and timber from Swietenia macrophylla). Particularly, Fiji has established significant plantation resources.
On these islands there is a high degree of endemic plants and animals and loss of habitat is likely to lead to extinction. The formal concept of conservation and protection is new and has to be agreed by the local communities' custodian of the land. However, remarkable sites and erosion-prone zones have a protected status.
Forestry Sector Development
Since around 1990, all islands have been involved in a sector planning process. Consequently, related forests laws and policies have been considerably improved and sustainability for forest operations has become a major concern. Forest administration and practices have been reviewed. Extension services are being supported. Efforts are being made to increase environmental awareness. The development of a forest based industry is a policy objective identified in all countries.
Projected development
Due to population pressure and limited land availability, natural forest will continue to be converted into agriculture land. Local customs could affect forestry sector development decisions. Poor education standard and shortage of well trained technicians could limit efforts for better forest management. Plantation programmes are unlikely to be accelerated due to political tension (Fiji), lack of funds and difficulties in obtaining land for planting.

POLYNESIA ISLANDS
The forest resources
Polynesia islands include Western Samoa, French Polynesia and a series of small islands ranging between 30 to 70,000 ha (Tonga, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Cook Islands, Norfolk Island, Pitcairh Island, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Wallis and Futura Islands). The climate is tropical but rainfall can be erratic. Some islands can suffer from droughts. Major storms and cyclones often occur. Soils are fertile when of volcanic origin or very poor when derived from coral limestones. Limited indigenous forest remains on the islands as commercial logging exhausted nearly all accessible and available forests. The major part of all land is under customary rights. High rate of forest clearance is done for agriculture and gardening. Coconut is the main crop and provides a major potential source for timber. Tree planting (Swietenia, Pinus Caribbea, Teak and Eucalyptus) is done to meet future local fuelwood/timber needs and for soil and watershed protection. Only few conservation measures are taken so far
to protect indigenous and endemic endangered species.
Forestry Sector Development
Development planning process exercises are generally at the early stage. However, Forest Acts are reviewed and recently adapted for sustainable management. Forestry is not seen as a Governmental priority but strategies for environmental management are emphasised. Agroforestry is seen as a major contributor for wood supply as further land would not be made easily available for forestry development.
Projected development
For the period till 2010, natural exploitable forests should continue to decrease slowly. However, farm forestry techniques will be promoted actively. Although areas under coconut should decrease and cyclones are likely to cause damages in tree plantations, the contribution of forest plantations and agroforestry should be significant and almost meet population needs. Due to environmental awareness increase, more forested areas may be put under conservation status.

INSULAR ASIA - SUB-REGIONAL STATUS AND PROJECTION
INDONESIA
MALAYSIA
PHILIPPINES
Countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines
The forest resources
The total area of forest and wooded lands (which include by definition forest fallows and shrubs) in Insular Asia will continue to decrease at a rate of about 1 % per year and particularly in Philippines and Malaysia. Conversion of forests for agriculture is still under way actively in the sub-region except in Philippines where the remaining natural forests are presently located mainly on lands unsuitable for agriculture. Fire, pests and shifting cultivation are adding more degradation to the forest cover. Only Indonesia still has vast areas of exploitable natural forests although a large part of it has been put under strict protection. However, the wealth of Indonesia cannot hide the dramatic situation of the forest in other parts of the sub-region such as in some Philippines islands. Forest are generally harvested under selective systems by private concessionaires. All countries have long experience in forest management but they all have examples involving heavy forest
degradation. Presently in all countries and despite obvious difficulties, there is a clear policy objective to strictly apply new sustainable management principles and regulations.
Tree plantations programmes are promoted in all countries and Indonesia will progressively achieve a significant plantation resource. Philippines and Malaysia programmes could be constrained by tenure problems and lack of appropriate incentives. Commercial crops areas - coconut and rubber for Indonesia and Malaysia, coconut for Philippines - are important and wood production will remain significant if active replanting of over-mature stock is done.
Forestry sector development
For the whole sub-region, it is expected that the prevailing forest degradation would improve progressively benefiting from the country efforts to slow-down deforestation processes. Economic prosperity may contribute to reduced direct pressure on the forests. Natural forest production should improve as sustainable forest management rules are applied. Large planned plantation programmes could be limited due to various problems related to land tenure and financing. Forest conservation concerns will remain important in forest sector development.
Wood production and fellings
Indonesia supplies about 75 % of the roundwood in the sub-region and has a ratio SI/fellings equal to 1 suggesting overall equilibrium between wood production and felling. Malaysia and Philippines show a chronic deficit in the SI/felling balance. Malaysia which was in the worse position in this respect in 1995 tends to improve slightly its balance during the period to 2010 (0.6 to 0.8). However, the Philippines situation is expected to worsen (0.7 to 0.6). This situation indicates a constant and global degradation of the forest formations in these two countries. Fellings in terms of fuelwood and industrial roundwood exceed what the forested lands and agricultural lands can provide sustainably in the present conditions. The total wood stock increment would increase slowly (11%) by 2010 due to plantation forests production and the significant contribution expected from agricultural lands (about half of the total stock increment).
Wood production from commercial crops will play an important role in local timber supply. Wood stock increment of natural exploitable forests would decrease in accordance with the continued loss and degradation of forested lands. Production from tree plantations will largely compensate the deficit from the natural exploitable forest. Industrial roundwood fellings from natural exploitable forest would decrease by about 13% mainly due to severe logging restriction in Malaysia. Fuelwood and domestic use should increase from 1995 by 26% in accordance with the population increase. It is interesting to note that Philippines figures related to wood production and supply are greater than the Malaysia ones although Malaysia has a larger forested area than Philippines.

INDONESIA
The forest resources
Indonesia is formed of a group of islands of which the main ones are Sumatra, Kalimantan, Java, Sulawesi, Maluku, Irian Jaya, Bali. The main land cover of Indonesia is forest (68%). The tropical forests in Indonesia are very diverse and they represent about 10% of all tropical forests of the world. The Wallace line divides Indonesia into two distinct vegetation and animal zones: the West contains the Dipterocarp forests and the East is more Australian type supporting lower volumes of commercial species. The dipterocarp forest ecosystem is economically important and represented in most of the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, the Moluccas. Dipterocarps are found in swamps and up to mountainous areas. Mangrove and other tidal-type forests, peat swamp forests have ecological importance. Approximately 44% of all productive forests are still unlogged and contain about 60% of all commercial volume of exploitable size. Forests are mainly owned and administered by the State.
Production forests are granted to private or state companies under logging concessions issued for specified periods. Logging concessions are managed on a selective system, the so-called TPTI (Indonesian Selective Cutting and Planting System) with a theoretical cutting cycle of 35-years and including a provision for tree planting. Logging damages are reported to be very high and concession management was poor up to now. The export of logs and raw rattan are banned as part of a national policy to develop local industries.
The population is unevenly distributed with over 100 million people (out of nearly 200 million) living in Java which accounts for only 7 % of the total land area. Indonesia is still an agricultural country and shifting cultivation is common. It is expected that by 2010 about 25-30 million additional hectares of forest will be converted into other uses such as agriculture development, resettlement of nomadic societies and mining activities. Indonesian households in rural areas rely heavily (80%) on fuelwood and local timber supply from home gardens and from agricultural estate crops. Indonesia has a very large rubber and coconut estate. Non wood forest products like rattan are socially and economically important.
Level of soil erosion is high and agro-forestry has been practised for a long time under regreening programmes. Forestry extension is strongly supported. Teak plantations are found in Java and Pinus merkusii and Eucalyptus are planted throughout Indonesia. State and private companies are involved in establishing large industrial plantations with fast growing species (Acacia mangium) for pulp production. However low product value, landuse overlaps, low technical knowledge and low return on investment are constraining plantations development.
About biodiversity, Indonesia is incredibly rich in species. Conservation areas account for 19 million ha; moreover, an additional 30 million ha of protection forests have been closed to all commercial uses including access by the public.
Forestry sector development
An Indonesian Forestry Action Programme was finalised in 1991. This plan is revised and up dated regularly to be in line with the National Development Plan for Forestry in the National five-year development plan. New forest related Acts and Decrees have been adopted and provide an appropriate framework for effective intersectoral cooperation for better utilisation of the forest resources. The Government is committed to sustainable forest management and to limit wood wastage and put in place in recent years marketing incentives, measures to rationalise the forest industries and to deregulate wood trade in accordance with its industrialisation programme. The state is promoting through incentives tree plantations for land conservation and to meet higher timber demand while reducing the area of natural forest harvested. Cooperation is active with bilateral and multilateral agencies and NGOs.
Projected development
The outlook of Indonesia is very promising assuming continuing strong economic growth to support the growing and active population. Whilst the forest areas would decrease to the benefit of the agriculture and pasture land, efficiency in wood production and utilisation would be improved due to better forest management and wood utilisation practices. Industrial and rural planting would continue to be promoted. However, it is expected that the planned industrial planting programme could be constrained by technical and funding problems. The ratio Si/Felling will stay almost balanced. Although a lot of efforts are made in forest management and plantations forests, the wood production versus supply will come slightly into deficit by the year 2010 mainly due to the increasing local consumption. Fuelwood supply will represent 81% of the total roundwood supply by 2010. At that time, the share of the tree plantation in industrial roundwood production would be about 42%.

MALAYSIA
The Forest Resources
Malaysia is a federation of three states: Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak. The climate of Malaysia is typically humid tropical or wet equatorial with a seasonal monsoon heavy rain. The topography generally consists of alluvial and swampy coastal plains with rolling hilly country inland and mountain ranges in the interior. Tropical forests cover about 58% of the total land area (68% if wooded lands are added). On plains and low hills, dipterocarp forest predominates and represents 87% of the total natural forests. The main species are from the genera Anisoptera, Dipterocarpus, Dryobalanops, Hopea, Shorea and Parashorea. On higher mountains, forest flora show more variations. Along the coast, swamp forests and mangrove have a particular ecological importance. Under the Malaysian Constitution, land is defined as a state matter and forest ownership is within the jurisdiction of the respective State Governments forming the Malaysian Federation.
On the total area of natural forest, a total of about 14 million hectares have been designated as the Permanent Forest Estate (PFE) which is under management. The Modified Malayan Uniform System (55-year cutting cycle) and the Selective Management System (30-year cutting cycle) are applied in Peninsular Malaysia. Selective harvests based on 50-year to 25-year cutting cycles are prescribed in the forests of the states of Sabah and Sarawak. Harvesting of forest resources is carried out by the private sector, ranging from individual operators to multinational companies. Currently, allocation of annual fellings coupes are based on forest inventory data. Harvesting practices have been very damaging for the natural stands and recovery from previous cuttings is not certain as forest loggers practices do not often comply with the prescribed management regulations. Logs export is banned in the Peninsular region and is still authorised in the two other regions.
Deforestation is said to be kept minimal but some forest areas are still being converted into other uses usually agriculture and resettlement of the population. Forests are also affected by shifting cultivation particularly in Sabah and Sarawak. Traditionally, forests have been an important source of raw material for the rural population. Rattan and bamboo's are planted and products represent an industrial asset. Fruits found in the natural forests are of economic value for the local population. Malaysia owns very large rubber and coconut estates which provide a large amount of industrial wood. Man-made forests have relatively limited area in Malaysia and aim mainly to either supply wood industries or to restock areas deforested by shifting cultivation.
Malaysia has over the years been establishing a network of protected areas for the conservation of biodiversity. About 1.39 million hectare have been totally protected as National Parks and Sanctuaries. Large tracts of the PFE have been put under protection status for the conservation of biological diversity. Additional national parks are under consideration.
Forestry sector development
Forestry development in the country is according to a series of "five year national development programmes". In 1992, the National Forestry policy was revised and more emphasis is given to sustainable management, involvement of communities in agroforestry programmes and appropriate conservation programmes. The objectives of the policy are implemented in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah while Sarawak is still relying on the former forest policy adopted in 1954. Also, the existing National Forestry Act was amended in 1993. Provisions are made to prepare and implement state forest management, to implement reforestation plans and to establish a Forest Development Fund. Consideration is given to long-term agreement for forest concessionaires and to provide incentives in forest plantation establishment. Furthermore, initiatives like the National Committee on Forest Plantation have been set-up to promote private sector investment in forest plantation programmes. Concerted efforts are
made with the private sector and communities to promote forest sector development and to ensure sustained yield management of the forests.
Projected development
Despite all efforts to control the depletion of the natural forest, enforcement of new laws and regulations to improve management practices will take some time. Natural forests will continue to decrease in terms of area and quality. Considering the present trend in deforestation, almost all natural forests outside the PFE would have been converted into other uses. Domestic consumption is increasing rapidly and possible shortage of timber and pulpwood is foreseen as the population augments rapidly. Malaysia is presently promoting tree plantations schemes with fast growing species but many difficulties arise such as availability of land, land tenure rights, financing incentives, fire protection. Planting objectives could not be achieved in the prevailing conditions. Potential to increase utilisation of wood from commercial tree crops exists although use of rubberwood is already high.
Although, log harvesting from natural forests will decrease regularly, the ratio SI/felling will be kept negative during the period meaning continued forest degradation. However, the ratio SI/felling will pass from 0.6 up to 0.8 indicating some improvement towards total wood production sustainability. Fuelwood share in the total domestic roundwood supply will be 25% (11% in 1990), as industrial roundwood supply will fall by 49% during the considered period. The share of industrial roundwood production from plantations forests will be relatively small (15%) by 2010 in comparison with natural exploitable forests.

PHILIPPINES
The Forest Resources
Forest cover in Philippines is 23% and is the lowest rate found in the insular Asia sub-region. The main forest types in Philippines are Dipterocarp forest, mountain forest (Podocarpus), limestone soil forest, Pine forest (Pinus keysia and P. merkusii) and mangrove. Massive deforestation, grazing, shifting cultivation, forest conversion for permanent subsistence agriculture have occurred legally or illegally during the past 20 years and the remaining exploitable natural forest area is presently very limited. By constitution, all forms of natural resources including forests are owned by the State. The dipterocarp forest is being harvested and logged in accordance with the Philippines Selective Logging system. Ideally the system aims at maintaining the uneven-aged structure of the original forest. However, the capacity of the system to maintain sustained yield forest is questionable; there are also difficulties in applying proper logging practices. In 1992, essentially all of
the remaining virgin forest was transferred to non-exploitable reserves and a total log ban is imposed in the virgin residual forest stands. The future wood supply should therefore come from second cut logging of the natural forests or from the plantation logging.
Deforestation remains high and caused by various factors such as forest fires, excessive firewood gathering, improper grazing practices, illegal logging and pests. Concerning the commercial crops, Philippines has a very large coconut estate (3 million ha) and rubber plantations cover about 80,000 ha. Alienable lands have been severely eroded throughout the country and large areas are denuded.
A national forestation programmes was launched in the 1980s and the objective is to plant up to 150,000 ha per year (Paraserianthes falcataria, Eucalyptus deglupta, Acacia mangium). Survival rate was considered very low at the beginning but is expected hopefully to increase considerably in the recently established plantations. Typhoons periodically cause serious damage to the plantation forests.
Large areas have been put under conservation status. However, many of the national parks, sanctuaries and watershed forest reserves are in critical condition and inadequately protected reportedly due to lack of funds and political will.
Forestry sector development
A Master Plan for Forestry Development (MPFD) was formulated in 1990. Massive funding is required to implement the plan and a lot has been forthcoming. A set of new regulations including a draft of the Forest Code, an Environmental Code, a National Integrated Protected Area System Act etc.. have been passed to conserve the forest resources and address the problems of environmental degradation. Public lands including integrated social forestry areas are presently distributed to the farmers under the Agrarian Reform programme. Tree planting programmes are ambitious but wrong price policies to harvest public forests has induced excessive logging and discouraged interest in reforestation.
Projected development
The forest situation in Philippines would imminently face huge problems if the implementation of the MPFD fails. Policy reforms that promote the development of the forest resources are needed. The short-term nature of timber licensing do not motivate private concessionaires to manage and harvest properly the forests. Would Philippines be able to put these reforms in place in time? The forest degradation will continue in spite of efforts to protect the remaining natural forest as the population pressure increases. Improvement of the harvesting practices and the rehabilitation of the logged over areas would help to get a long-term sustainable supply of 3.2 million m^3 of industrial roundwood. Lack of investment capital and secure tenure are major constraints for industrial forest plantations and only limited incentives are assumed to be made available to adequately support rural forestry and agroforestry.
The (wood Stock Increment) SI/felling ratio will remain relatively stable but in deficit during the considered period. Fuelwood supply represents 92% of total roundwood supply, the balance being used as industrial roundwood! MAI is relatively high in comparison with other sub-regional countries as all forests are already logged over.

Countries: Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia.
The forest resources
Forests in Continental south-east Asia are, generally speaking, of tropical types (Dipterocarpus sp., teak) in the South and low lands and of temperate types (Pinus sp.) in the north and at higher altitudes. Since the second world war, natural forests have been rapidly depleted and particularly in plains and river deltas and zones of agriculture expansion. The sub-region remains fairly heavily forested, forest and wooded lands presently cover about 62% of total land area. The quality of the natural stands is however often poor and exploitable forests count for only 34% of the forested lands. Depletion is still continuing at about 1 % per year with remaining natural forests often located in remote areas. Wars have helped to accelerate forest degradation and consequent scars will take time to fade.
Forest lands belong generally to the States. However, increasing efforts are done like in Vietnam to involve farmers and private sector to participate in forestry development and conservation by allocating forest lands to individuals and organisations. Logging operations have been practised under the concessions system and following forest management prescriptions based on selective cutting and silvicultural operations. The system did not function properly for many reasons and the accessible forests have been creamed and depleted. Forest degradation is such and the control is so weak that many countries have established strong limitations for logging and Thailand even banned all type of logging in natural forest. Export trade in logs is often illegal but where countries share long frontiers and there is local instability, illicit trade is believed to occur.
The sub-region has many ethnic minorities living in the mountainous zones who survive on shifting cultivation and depend significantly on forest products. Population pressure, economic development and agricultural expansion have transformed the former balanced forest fallow system into a destructive process. Total expected decrease of forested area by the year 2010 would be up to 10% of the 1995 situation to the benefit of agricultural or range or waste lands. Exploitable forests will be reduced to about 31% of the forests and wooded lands by 2010.
Commercial tree-crop plantations are large in Thailand and Vietnam, including rubber plantations, the wood from which is efficiently utilised. Area expansion perspectives suggest that by the year 2010, the area of tree plantations will increase by 88%; but the total planted area in the sub-region would remain relatively small in comparison with the declining state of the natural forests and the future possible demand. Thailand and Vietnam are planning large plantation schemes which would start producing from the next century.
All countries of the sub-region are involved in forest conservation and are establishing protected area networks. The total percentage of land under protection rules is satisfactory but the effectiveness of the protection is questionable and not all ecosystem types may be adequately represented.
Forestry sector development
New economic policies will boost the global development of the sub-regional countries. Forests could not benefit from the expected rapid development. Due to problems related to ethnic minorities, political unrest, population increase, urban and infrastructure building, the forest will continue to be degraded although it is expected that deforestation per se could be put under some control. Wood stock increment will not compensate the total fellings by the year 2010. Wood demand and forest conservation concern will increase in accordance with the economic development by the turn of the century; the forest resources situation in terms of domestic supply could become worrying if forested lands are not rehabilitated or wood production from not forested lands is not enhanced.
Considering the SI/felling ratio, the 1995 positive situation will become negative by 2010. This is due to a slow and steady depletion of the forests accompanied with an increasing supply. Although Thailand is provided with relatively limited forested areas, wood supply and production are high comparatively with other countries of the region.
Wood supply and fellings
Total wood supply in the sub-region is still globally satisfactory but the balance between wood stock annual increment supply and total felling would become negative by the year 2010. Fellings will increase rapidly and particularly the domestic supply (fuelwood and local timber needs). Industrial roundwood production will come increasingly from tree plantations passing 28 % in 1990 up to 55 %. It is to be noticed that wood production from agricultural lands would be relatively low (less than 20% of the total production).
The commercial growing stock will decline steadily as the tree plantations programmes will not yet make up for the degradation of the natural forests during the period till 2010. Forest waste and residues is expected to remain generally high due to weak forestry management and sometimes war conditions.

The Forest resources
Myanmar is well endowed with one of the largest forest covers in the Asia/Pacific region. The country has about 76% of its land area under forests and woody cover. Myanmar is a country of considerable topographic and climatic contrasts. The country ranges from coastal lowlands with heavy monsoon rainfall in the south to very rugged and snow-capped mountainous areas in the north (up to 6,000 meters). The central core of the country is flat and relatively dry. The mixed deciduous forest is the most economically important type as it is the major source of teak. Other hardwoods (Tylia sp., Pterocarpus sp.) are harvested from dipterocarp forests and dry forests. Native pines (P. Merkusii and P. Insularis) are found in temperate zones. Bamboos and mangroves areas are notable. In general, all forests belong to the State. Commercial forests are managed for about 100 years using the Myanmar Selection System: a 30-year cutting cycle with a specified minimum harvested diameter. Log
export is being gradually reduced in order to promote local processing.
The underlying causes of forest degradation are socio-economic problems including scarcity of land in densely populated areas, encroachment for agricultural expansion, shifting cultivation, low agricultural productivity, illegal fuelwood and timber extraction. The dry zone area is particularly threatened. Non-wood products like rattan, indigenous medicine, barks are important for the rural population (80% of the total). Myanmar has a small rubberwood and coconut plantations but has a significant tree plantation estate. Commercial tree plantations (50% of the total) are mostly teak, industrial and village plantations are established with fast growing species (eucalyptus) respectively for eventual pulp production or local supply of fuelwood/poles and erosion control.
Myanmar is particularly wealthy in biodiversity. Many plant and wildlife species are endemic and some endangered. Sanctuaries and national parks covering 1 % of the country have been established so far.
Forestry sector development
A Myanmar Forest Policy was formulated in 1995 and is in accordance with UNCED principles. Old concepts of forest management have been turned away. The forest policy suggests a balanced approach to environmental conservation and development by, inter alia, gazetting reserved and protected forests, encouraging participatory forestry, decentralising and intensifying silviculture and management, and promoting private investment in timber production and trade. A new Forest Law was promulgated in 1992 and is in line with the forest policy recognising the importance of the social dimensions and grassroots involvement in managing the forest estate. Preparation of a National Forestry Action Plan was initiated in 1995. Great efforts are now being undertaken in reforestation in dry or fragile zones and managing the natural stands. The establishment of national parks and protected areas has been accelerated to achieve 5% of the total land area.
Projected development
Forest degradation and deforestation will remain rapid due to population pressure. It is reasonable to assume that the felling of industrial roundwood will increase significantly in the near future. The forest potential exists as well as the internal and external markets. If they continue to be done by public entities, harvesting operations will continue to generate considerable wood waste. MAI of tree plantations will remain relatively low due to slow teak growth and the quality of past plantations. Chronic budget insufficiency due to centrally controlled budget allocation could refrain sector development still almost entirely based on State organisations.
The SI/felling ratio is presently good but the ratio figure will decrease regularly during the considered period meaning a constant erosion in wood production and a rapid increase in wood supply. Although wood stock increment is relatively high for industrial purposes, wood production from arable lands would remain relatively low generating possible fuelwood shortages in populated areas located far from the forested areas.

VIETNAM
The Forest resources
Vietnam's topography is mainly mountainous and the majority of the population is concentrated in alluvial plains. The forest resources base for natural forest is diverse and comprises temperate and sub-tropical pine dominant forests (Pinus merkusii, P. kesiya), mixed conifer-broadleaves associations (Podocarpus sp.), dry dipterocarp types (Lagerstroemia sp., Pterocarpus sp.) in upland zones, moist lowland dipterocarp forests (Dipterocarpus sp., Anisoptera sp.) and mangroves. Although Vietnam's forest and wooded lands is reported to be 70% of the total national land, the remaining natural forests stands are degraded and often formed of poor forests, bushes, wastelands and denuded hills. The combined effects of long wars, shifting cultivation and excessive logging have reduced the rich and medium quality natural forests to about 1.4 million ha relegated to mountainous and inaccessible areas.
So far, all forested lands are owned by the state but a major shift has been initiated in allocating forest land to non-state units, encouraging individual tenure of forest resources. Ethnic populations are important in Vietnam and they are mainly located in the highlands. They rely heavily on the forests for food and other basic supplies and they practice slash and burn agriculture. Although deforestation seems to be stabilised, forest fragmentation is increasing with insidious and continuous decline of the quality and diversity of the natural stands. In general, forest management practices are based upon selective cutting at a 20 to 35 year cycle plus an intensive post-harvest weeding and enrichment programme. However, silvicultural operations are generally delayed and logging is often opening ways for agricultural encroachment. The loss of forest cover is a matter of concern for watershed protection. Logging in natural forests has been restricted to a minimum.
Wood produced from rubber and coconut estates is utilised intensively. Due to the rapid natural forest depletion, Vietnam has promoted large afforestation programmes mainly to green denuded and degraded lands. Reportedly, up to 1985 and throughout the central planning period, the rate of tree survival in plantations was very poor. Presently, new policies and particularly the allocation of. forest land to farmers, forest workers and to the private sector is expected to improve the tree planting operations quality.
Some forests are classified as "special use forest" which recognises scenic, amenity, scientific and cultural values. A network of conservation areas has been established but effective protection is not yet achieved.
Forestry sector development
Development forest policies are being progressively adjusted in line with the country's move towards a market economy. In 1991, a National Forestry Action Programme (NFAP) review the forestry sector was undertaken and the forest policy was entirely renovated. A new forest law was promulgated and investment programmes - funding allocation for 1,200 local projects and credit schemes - were put in place to preserve the forest resource and to develop tree plantations. A decree of January 1994 allocated land for long-term purposes to organisations, households and individuals. The administrative system is still weak but the external assistance are providing support to strengthen planning capacity, effectiveness and sustainability of long-term investment. Further policy adjustments are also being considered.
Projected development
The transition period between the central and market economy has been quite successful in Vietnam. Rapid economic advances have been made. Increasing flows of investment capital are pouring into the country. Although the human resources base is not well trained to operate in the new policy framework, it is expected that rapid improvement and development will be done in the all sectoral activities. Tree plantations areas and quality are expected to increase. Wood production from natural forests will decrease and the increasing roundwood demand will be progressively met by rural and industrial plantations.
The ratio SI/felling is presently in deficit meaning that wood supply is higher than wood production. However, the ratio would improve as total fellings would increase by 45% and the total wood stock increment by 62% by 2010. Wood production from plantations would increase significantly during the period and would be about 90% of the industrial roundwood production.

LAOS (PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF)
The Forest resources
Laos (Lao People's Democratic Republic) is a land-locked country. About 75% of the land area is hilly to mountainous, predominantly in the North to the East; the rest is occupied by the low-lying plains of the Mekong River. The country has a tropical climate dominated by the monsoon rains. Forests and wooded lands cover about 85% of the total land comprising natural forests known as "current forests" (47%) and shrubs and poorly-stocked open forests called "potential forests" (38%). The major forest types are mixed deciduous (75%), evergreen and dry dipterocarp (22%), and coniferous (3%). Teak, Rosewood, Terminalia are some commercial species highly demanded. About 75% of the population is highly dependent on the country's natural resources base for its survival.
Most villages have well established access and use rights to forests within areas under their traditional control. Traditional village forest areas were usually managed under a sustainable shifting cultivation system. An elected committee had to carry out local level planning. However, the system breakdown when outsiders engaged in illegal logging and agricultural encroachment. Commercial forestry operations are based on a concession system which has failed to achieve sustained yield management. Unclear licensing procedures, unenforceable contractual agreements have encouraged unsustainable commercial exploitation, featuring destructive logging practices and no attempt at restoration. As some neighbouring countries face acute shortages of timber (Thailand, China), illegal transactions of logs are thought to be important and are worsening the situation.
Although the population density is relatively low, encroachment of forests is increasing in accordance with the high rate of population expansion and in the absence of subsistence alternatives to shifting cultivation (estimated at about 300,000 ha/year). In the recent past, wood products and non-wood forest products (such as Benzoin, and rattan) have accounted for 40% of export earnings. The forestry sector makes a very major contribution to the country's GDP.
The country's extensive areas of relatively undisturbed forest contain a rich diversity of ecosystems and species. Conservation programmes are based on the establishment of protected areas and on maintaining ecological processes for the conservation of forests resources. A total of 69 potential protected areas have been identified. So far, 20 National Biodiversity Conservation Areas have been legally established covering about 10% of the whole country.
Forestry sector development
A National Forestry Action Programme was prepared in 1990 and reviewed in 1994. Six main development programmes were proposed for financing, giving priority to the rationalisation of shifting cultivation and to watershed protection. In 1993, a new forest policy was promulgated. This policy promotes private investments in the sector and relies more on farmers for tree planting. Forest protection and management, sustainability of wood yields and reduction of the depletion of the forest resource base are also on the forest policy agenda. However, the success of these programmes is very dependent on stabilizing shifting cultivation which will remain the highest priority.
Projected development
A combination of high rate of population increase, grazing problems, shifting cultivation, illegal logging, weak forest institutions and lack of basic information presents nearly insurmountable hurdles to sustainable forestry. Decentralisation accompanied by good coordination between central and local levels are needed for better development. More than a good forest policy, a strong economic development is needed to overcome the present forest degradation trends.
The very good ratio SI/felling of 1990 will decline rapidly by 2010 showing evidence of the constant depletion of the natural exploitable forests. Roundwood production will decrease by 8% whilst roundwood supply will augment by 41%! Low productive and open forests cover very large areas and should deserve special attention considering the little plantation programme and the weak forest management control.

THAILAND
The Forest resources
From 1960, Thailand's forest cover has been reduced from 54% to about 27% of the total land in the process of its rapid development. Presently, forests are mainly located in relatively inaccessible areas. Evergreen montane rain forest (Dipterocarps sp., Shorea sp., Hopea sp.), mixed deciduous monsoon (Tectona grandis) and dry dipterocarp savanna forests are restricted to the mountainous areas. Valleys and plains are totally cultivated by the largely agricultural population. Thailand has had the highest deforestation rate (3.3% - 450,000 ha/year) in the sub-region and its forest management practices based nominally on selective cutting and felling cycle in logging concessions appear to have been totally ineffective.
To stop the dramatic deforestation, Thailand instituted a logging ban in 1989 and is embarked in a series of drastic measures to protect the remaining forests and to promote private involvement in forest management and plantations. Other forest lands would be allocated to farmers and communities with a package of incentives for reforestation and disincentives for any conversion of the land use. Natural forests will provide multiple and special purpose products; tree plantations of various species should meet the needs for wood products. Rural forestry and industrial tree plantations are therefore strongly promoted. The tree plantation estate is already large. The vast rubber and coconut plantations are also providing significant amounts of industrial roundwood.
Concerning the conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, the Protected Areas System and other remaining forests will be managed considering, as a priority, wild habitats protection. Large areas of natural forests (about 90% of the remaining natural forest) would be kept as a Protected Area system under the responsibility of the State. A network of nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries covering about 10% of the total land has been established.
Forestry sector development
In 1993, a Forestry Sector Master Plan (FSMP) was drafted. Three major programmes have been proposed: the socio-ecological dimension covers conservation and forest based and urban development aspects; the technological dimension covering the management of the multipurpose forests and man-made forests; and the institutional development programme including policy and legal reforms. The FSMP is rather ambitious and calls for important land and policy reforms. Tree plantations are already extensive and the log ban seems to be respected.
Projected development
The basis for a dynamic sectoral development is in place but important prerequisite reforms are still to be promulgated and implemented. Taking into account the logging ban imposed by the government, the growing environmental awareness but also high level of unrecorded logging in the natural forest, a 2.2% annual deforestation rate has been applied for the time of the scenario. Total forest cover would shrink down to 22% by 2010. The effects of the forest policy changes related to natural forest management would be felt progressively but reasonable recover will take time. Reforestation programmes should accelerate but would depend upon the appropriate market conditions and incentives proposed to the private sector. By 2010, tree plantations area would have increased significantly.
The deficit of the SI/felling ratio will remain stable but in deficit showing constant depletion of the forests.

CAMBODIA
The forest resources
The forest area of Cambodia is large (69% of the land area) and its distribution quite varied. Evergreen (Dipterocarpus sp., Anisoptera, Hopea sp.) and dry deciduous Dipterocarp (Dipterocarpus sp., Shorea sp., Terminalia sp.) forests are found in the north and west; southern and central parts of the country have less important forests and face shortages even of fuelwood. Over the last twenty years, the forests of Cambodia have been degraded mainly as a consequence of war. The cumulative effects of illegal commercial logging, uncontrolled shifting cultivation and excessive wood harvesting for fuelwood and charcoal are reflected in widespread and severe degradation of the natural forests. In principle, all forests are State owned but illegal harvesting activities reportedly make illusory any type of forest management. A total log trade and export ban was imposed in 1994 but control is not yet effective. Available data on forest cover, potential of the resource base and forests
products are limited. Weak infrastructure does not permit easy raw material transport and remaining woodlands in the populated areas are under heavy pressure. Cambodia has few commercial tree crops and forest plantations. As of 1993, all edaphic forests and part of the dry lands forests have been designated as for biodiversity conservation. A total of about 3.5 million ha are under some protection but the effectiveness of management is severely limited.
Forestry sector development
Cambodia has only recently launched a planning process for forestry development. A lot of work has to be done regarding the preparation of new forest legislations and policies. The whole forestry sector development has to be rethought in terms of local participation and private sector involvement. However, major prerequisites such as the definition of the land use and the forest administration reorganisation have to be met. Sustained Forestry sector development is dependent on complete cessation of the civil war.
Projected development
Forests are presently difficult to access and work because of security problems. About 50% of the forests are mined or controlled by fighting parties. Shifting cultivation, illegal cutting, forest degradation will continue unabated for the next future. Even when peace returns, the country reconstruction will probably accelerate the demand on the forest. Could some improvement of the forest situation be expected at the beginning of the next century?
The deficit of the SI/felling ratio should increase steadily due to the constant production depletion of the natural forest not compensated by plantation production. Roundwood felling would increase significantly in 2005 and 2010 as a consequence of post-war reconstruction needs.

SOUTH ASIA - SUB-REGIONAL STATUS AND PROJECTION ANALYSIS
INDIA
NEPAL
PAKISTAN
BHUTAN
SRI LANKA
BANGLADESH
Countries: India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh.
The forest resources
India is by far the biggest country of the sub-region; its forest and wooded lands area represents about 83% of the sub-regional total. Closed natural forests are generally found in the mountains areas such as along the Himalayan range particularly in Nepal and Bhutan. Dry zones occupy large areas in India and Pakistan, while mangroves are important in river-deltas like in Bangladesh. The total forest and wooded lands are expected to continue to decrease but loss of natural forest would be partially compensated by tree plantations. Natural forests are owned by the state (about 80%) or communities. It is expected that 9% of the total present exploitable forest area would be lost by the year 2010 and Bangladesh in particular would lose about 33% of its remaining exploitable forests. Shifting cultivation practices (tribal lands) and grazing problems will not be kept under appropriate control. However, due to the large plantation effort in India, the total forest and wooded land
area is expected to slightly increase during the period.
It is assumed that plantation forests programmes will be dynamic and that about 5 million additional ha would be planted between 1995 and 2010. A major feature of the sub-region is the high level of population in the main countries. Linkages between agriculture and forestry are obvious and will have to be close to meet the wood needs of the growing population. Present tenure problems and land availability shortage will favour rural forestry and agroforestry.
Sector development perspectives
Since the 1990s, new laws and regulations are adopted to protect and properly manage the forests. However, the priority given to agriculture development and the weak implementation capacity of the forest administration prevailing in the majority of the South Asia countries would limit the effects of proposed sectoral improvement.
Fuelwood and local timber would continue to be the major problems of the sub-region. The problem could become dramatic in certain places. The sector development is still not dynamic enough and the natural forest will continue to fill the gap between wood increment and felling. The proper answer to the main sub-regional forest problems probably lies in providing the capability to the population to satisfy a greater share of its own domestic needs from farm lands.
Wood supply and fellings
Total roundwood deficit will increase significantly (about 21 %) during the 15 year period 1995-2010. The ratio SI/felling will decrease from 1 in 1990 down to 0.8 by 2010. Fuelwood supply would become a dramatic problem in dry zones where the potential for wood production in rural areas is low. Countries are taking measures to limit wood consumption per capita (Bangladesh, Pakistan, India) but the rapid population growth leads to continued increase in total consumption.
The future situation is very sensitive to population trends and to the wood production potential of rural arable lands: agricultural lands are vast and any positive action on their wood production as well as on the rural and urban population balance has a direct effect on the wood supply balance. Commercial tree crops can play a significant role in some specific areas (Sri Lanka and Bangladesh) in wood supply.
Fuelwood supply represents about 88% of the total roundwood fellings and this percentage will remain about the same. Roundwood production from farmlands is about 50% of the total Stock Increment. Industrial roundwood felling will increase by 35% during the period while 78% of the production will mainly come from tree plantations by 2010 (about 60% in 1990).

The Forest resources
In India, forest conditions are very diverse and forest resources are far from equally distributed. Forests cover about 28% of the total country land. Main forest types include tropical moist deciduous (sal forests), tropical dry (teak forests) and wet tropical evergreen forests. More limited temperate forests with fir, spruce and pine forest can be found at altitude near the Himalayas. Indian forests are under high pressure to supply forest products to a growing population (66% rural). Many poor people and particularly the tribal people (8% of the total population) depend on forests for their subsistence. Fuelwood represents about 90 % of the demand for wood and is the most important form of household energy in both rural and urban areas.
Wood deficit is large and the forest industries are facing raw material shortages. Forests are overexploited and productivity in natural forests and plantations is relatively low. Shifting cultivation in tribal areas, agricultural encroachment, fires and illegal removals are reported to be rapidly degrading the forest resources. The problem is further compounded by the very high cattle population being allowed to graze freely in forest areas (see references - World Bank, 1993). This has led to severe erosion and loss of soil. Almost all of the tropical evergreen forests are managed under the selection system (selective felling). The reduction in felling cycles and other similar practices could compromise long-term sustainability of the forests as suppliers of wood. However, changing management practices are being implemented with private sector or community participation. Large afforestation schemes have been launched to rehabilitate wasteland with community participation
but results are variable. Technological weaknesses have limited the productivity and impact of those efforts. About 12 million ha (4% of the country) are protected, of which 8 million ha are forested.
Forestry sector development
For several decades India has been emphasising on sustainable development of the forest resources as well as conservation of the ecosystems to counteract the rapid degradation process. The Forest (Conservation) Act (1980) has somewhat reduced the rate of forest lands diversion for non-forestry purposes and the National Forest Policy (1988) wishes to achieve one-third of the national territory under forest cover through large efforts in planting. India has since 1993 embarked upon preparation of a National Forestry Action Programme (NFAP), this is not yet completed. Difficulties are enormous given the sub-continental dimensions of the country, variations in the forest resources and conditions prevailing throughout the different states and decentralized responsibility for forests. India has a long tradition of professional forestry and the public sector which controls 90% of the forest land has taken all management roles but failed to achieve its goals. Structure and
procedures of the forest administrations cannot cope effectively with new challenges such as how to revitalize the considerable potential in farm forestry development. Schemes involving communities hold potential but are so far operating over limited forest areas but have an important contribution to tree planting on farms and wasteland. The private sector has not contributed as much to developing the forest sector due mainly to lack of incentives and inappropriate regulations. Concessional pricing policies have led to wastage of raw materials.
Projected development
The estimated exploitable forests cover of about 22 million ha of natural and semi natural exploitable forests will continue to shrink and to decline in quality due to population pressures (shifting cultivation) and poor management practices. This is reflected in the decreasing of the forest area and the growing stock with consequent decline in capacity to meet the various needs of the population. India has Asia's second-largest plantation forests area in 1990; this was estimated at 12 million ha and should increase by 0.25 million ha per year steadily to attain 17 million ha by 2010. Removals mainly for fuelwood will remain high since economic growth (which has recently accelerated) will not yet have reduced poverty adequately to significantly reduce fuelwood-dependency. Although technical progress will be made in terms of planting and management capabilities, policy development may not be fast enough to achieve better private sector involvement. The involvement of a wider
audience in the NFAP process would help to consolidate States strategies for development and to formulate appropriate action plans in accordance with the dimension of the problems. The ratio stock increment/felling is expected to go into deficit by year 2010 indicating a slow but continuing depletion of the natural forest. Fuelwood and local timber fellings represent about 88% of the total roundwood fellings. This percentage will be constant although the total roundwood fellings is expected to increase by 27% during the period 1995-2010.

NEPAL
The forest resources
Nepal lies in the subtropical zone but a wide variety of climatic conditions exist due to the mountainous topography. Natural forest covers about 37% of the land area (of which about 59% are broad-leaved stands, 17% conifer, and 24% mixed stands). Forests are more or less evenly distributed but very high pressure occurs in the accessible forests (about 50% of the natural forest area) mainly located in the Terai region and along ridges and valleys of the middle mountains where population is concentrated.
Only limited scientific forest management has been applied appropriately on the national forest land. Natural forest area is shrinking/degrading, creating problems of soil and water conservation. In coniferous forests, logging has been suspended. Throughout Nepal, agriculture and forestry are closely linked. Forest are used for grazing and fodder collection for livestock. Over 80% of the country's energy is derived from fuelwood. About 80,000 ha of plantation have been established all over Nepal and a special effort for community forestry is in progress. The protected area network is reported to be successful and the area may be extended further though not very significantly. At present, 14% of Nepal's land area is under the protected area system. The areas surrounding national parks are planned to be managed as buffer zones which will also contribute to the production of forest produce.
Forestry sector Development
Nepal adopted a Forestry Sector Master Plan and Policy (1990 - 2010) in 1989. In 1992, a Forest Act was passed which incorporated many of the changes proposed in the Master plan. The new law is designed to transfer a major portion of forest land use and management back to local forest user groups, while retaining under government management those areas deemed to have national value for timber and environmental protection. The major thrust of the forest policy implementation will remain involving local people in the management of local forest resources. Community forestry will start to market forest products and services but their quantity and market share is difficult to estimate at present.
Projected development
Although there are significant efforts to stop natural forest degradation, it will take time to see the results of the reforms and programmes proposed by the new law and the master plan. The degradation of the natural forest will continue due to rural people's intensive use of natural forests. The plantation programme cannot entirely compensate for the wood loss caused by the natural forest degradation. The wood fellings should increase significantly due mainly to population increase.
The ratio SI/felling is largely in deficit and this position will become worse in 2010. Wood production increase (6%) will not match the increase of wood demand (49%). Fuelwood and local timber will represent in 2010, about 91% of the total fellings. The share of industrial roundwood produced from natural forests will pass from 23% down to 16% by 2010, while wood from plantation forest will pass from 6% up to 17%. Contribution of agricultural land in roundwood production will increase from 37% in 1990, up to 43% by 2010.

PAKISTAN
Forest resources situation
Pakistan is a forest-poor country (4.8% of the total land area). Generally speaking, the climate of Pakistan is dry continental, with scanty rainfall. Pakistan bears varied forests ranging from the scrub vegetation in the desert to dense coniferous forests in the North. Natural forests are confined to the mountainous areas, dry forest hills and along river basins. Forest types are mainly tropical and temperate forests; 85% of the forest cover is publicly owned. The roundwood production is mainly coniferous and concentrated in the northern hills and mountains. Irrigated plantations, forests along major rivers and mangrove forests provide some supply. About 500,000 ha are already planted on private lands. With population growing at about 3% annually, pressure on forests and watersheds is very high. Agriculture is given precedence over other land uses as food production is in deficit; overgrazing is a major problem for forest management. The present wood consumption exceeds the
sustainable growth of forests by a wide margin.
Forestry sector development
In 1992, Pakistan published a Master Plan for Forest Sector Development (MPFSD) which recommends, inter alia, strategies to manage forests and rangelands and encourages private land owners to plant trees. Watershed protection and development has been accorded highest priority. Agricultural policy adopted in 1991 envisaged increase of the existing total forest area up to 10% of the country land during the next 15 years. A National Conservation Strategy was adopted in 1992. Tree plantation programmes are ambitious. Forestry is a provincial responsibility with forest and range management programmes vested in provincial forest departments; however, policy is a federal responsibility. The whole sector may need strengthened cohesion if its development goals are to be achieved. People are poor, have low literacy and are often not in a position to cooperate in efforts to conserve and develop forest resources. No clear legislative measures have been taken to engage the private sector
in forestry programmes.
Projected development
Although policy efforts are done to cope with the dramatic situation, the institutional capacity of the forestry administration, at both central and provincial levels, is still very weak and no significant progress for better forest management has been assumed for the near future. All indicators point to problems: for example, plantation programme is limited to 25,000 ha per year due to low investment and weak technical capacities. It is unlikely that the Government can put more forest under conservation status due to the population pressure and forest products needs.
The ratio SI/felling was approximately balanced in 1995 and will go down during the period showing a possible depletion of the forest formations. Total wood stock increment is very sensible to trees raised on agricultural lands under agroforestry and rural development programmes. A 1/10 point change in MAI arable land has a significant impact on the ratio SI/felling.

BHUTAN
The Forest resources
Bhutan is a landlocked mountainous country with a relatively low population density. The forests cover more than 72 % of the country area and most of the land remains in natural state. Forest types are numerous and range from tropical and subtropical forests to pine, spruce and alpine forests in the higher elevation. Only a few forests are managed. Tree plantations are established in degraded forests and to replant or interplant commercially logged forest areas. Wood companies may obtain long term forest lease concessions.
Agriculture (arable lands) takes only 7% of the total land and shifting cultivation is still regularly practiced. Pressure on forest and trees is still relatively low but some degradation due to overgrazing and overburning is occurring in some places. National parks, sanctuaries and reserves have been set up and cover about 26% of the total land area.
Forestry sector Development
A Forestry Master Plan was approved in 1991 and a Forestry Programme Framework has been adopted to put into practice the Plan proposals. It is expected that the Forest Act will soon be revised and ensure legal consistency inside the sector. Priority is given to environmental conservation and self-sufficiency in wood products. Natural resources planning is constrained by the lack of inventory data and management plans.
Projected development
There are unlikely to be major changes in the sector by year 2010. The planning and legal framework are good and Bhutan is receiving significant external support. Perspectives for improved forest conditions are good. The wood stock increment/felling ratio is highly positive but will go down regularly as forests are supplying more wood than they produce.

SRI LANKA
The forest resources
Sri Lanka consists of a south central highland area culminating at 2,500 meters surrounded by lowland plains. Tropical monsoon and mountainous topography determine its many contrasting climatic zones. Tropical rain forest is the original vegetation in the wet and mountainous zone with gradual changes in accordance to the elevation; savannahs and arid coastal forests are found in the dry lowland zones. Almost (90%) all forest lands are managed by the State administration. Deforestation is one of the major environmental problems. Management of the forests and enforcement for the laws and regulations have both been ineffective. The increasing commercialisation of the rural economy has resulted in a rising demand for many forest products and the over-exploitation of the growing stock of the remaining forest resources. Various NWFP have traditionally played a major role in the rural economy. Industrial plantations are poorly managed and utilised. But Sri Lanka is reported to be
surprisingly still self-sufficient in most forest products: home gardens and crop plantations produce more than two thirds of the national roundwood supply and this may explain the high level of self-reliance.
Sri Lanka is endowed with extremely high levels of biological diversity. Total protected areas (mainly in the dry zones) amount to about 14% of the country's land area.
Forestry Sector Development
Two Forestry Master Plans have been prepared so far. The first Master Plan (1983-86) resulted in the Forest Sector Development project (co-financed by the World Bank and other donors) which has had a decisive impact on the environmental management of the country. The second Master Plan 1995-2020 is policy, strategy and programme oriented. A National Forestry Policy was adopted in March 1995 by the Government giving emphasis to conservation of biodiversity (formulation of a National Environmental Action Programme) and emphasizing partnership with local people, communities and private sector in all forest development activities. Establishment and management of industrial plantations on State lands would be entrusted progressively to the private sector. Home gardens and agroforestry systems would play a increasing role in meeting the demand for wood. However, new laws, rules and regulations need to be drafted and adopted to implement the proposed forest policies.
Projected development
Civil unrest continues and will certainly continue to have a negative impact on budget allocation for sectoral development until resolved. Trained manpower is inadequate to implement the Master Plan programmes. The present policy system does not provide incentives for increasing productivity and profitability of the tree plantations which remain too low to meet the future wood demand. No change in wood production is expected to occur in the period till 2010. The major part of wood production would come from home gardens and commercial tree crops. Fuelwood supply is expected to satisfy the future demand; but shortage of processed timber is expected. The wood stock increment (SI)/felling ratio should decrease steadily and the country would face an overall deficit in wood production by the year 2010.

BANGLADESH
The Forest resources
Bangladesh is located in the active delta of three major rivers and its climate is directly influenced by the tropical monsoon. Forests and wooded land cover 17% of this densely populated country. The main forest types are the mangrove forest, the hill forest (mixed dipterocarp forest) and the plain forest (Sal forest) and homestead plantations. Bamboo is an important forest resource found in natural forest and in private lands. Bangladesh is a very densely populated country and the per capita land is perhaps the lowest in the world. Due to the extreme pressure of the population, the forests are heavily encroached and the stock is degraded continuously. Primary production (80%) of logs and bamboos comes from private lands (homestead and farm trees) and secondly from government managed forests. The improper management of the state forests has led to the imposition of a government moratorium on all logging in natural forests. Regeneration of natural forest is done by planting
trees in the natural forest which has been clearfelled. Wood is not available in most rural areas. Annual per capita wood consumption is one of lowest in the developing world as energy consumption is dominated by biomass fuels including agricultural residues and dung.
State owned forest constitutes about 80% of the total forest area (state forest land is reported often barren of tree vegetation), while the remainder consists of privately controlled village forests spread throughout the country. Since long, the Government is involved in tree plantations (mangroves, teak) and is presently committed in fast growing species plantation programmes (eucalyptus, acacia). All types of tree plantations are supported whether along the roadsides, canal banks, or near homesteads. However, the involvement of the private sector in raising commercial forest plantations is rather limited. Rubber plantations contribute to supply of roundwood. Protected areas cover less than 1% of the country's total area and most of the parks and sanctuaries are reported to be degraded.
Forestry Sector Development
The Bangladesh Master Plan for Forestry Development (BMPFD) was completed in 1993 and adopted by the Government in 1995. The main focus areas include introducing rational forest land use, increasing public participation, expanding the resource base and improving management practices and efficient resource utilisation. The proposed programmes have been endorsed by the Government and integrated in the five year development plan (1996-2000). The forest policy was revised in 1994 but a new forest legislation is still to be introduced. However, a number of policy decisions have recently been taken, such as the moratorium on all exploitation in state forest land, the ban on the use of fuelwood for brick making and the launching of a participatory forestry programme on non-government forest land. However, planning and plan-implementation capabilities of the forest administration are weak.
Projected development
The forestry sector has received strong support from the Government and assistance from external agencies. Forest are depleted and the moratorium of all exploitation on state forest lands should help forests to recover. Part of the solution to wood shortages and to releasing pressure on natural forests would be private plantations; farmer planting attitude is reportedly very positive but questions of land ownership and tree tenure rights impede planting programmes development. A serious fall in bamboo supplies is expected by the end of the century while cyclones in coastal areas cause extensive damage and forestry capacity is undermined by shortage of good technical forestry standards, methods and practices; and deteriorating administration staff morale.
The stock increment/felling ratio is presently in balance, however, it will become in deficit during the period a total roundwood supply will increase more (57%) than total roundwood production (4%). Production figure is low due to the deforestation factor. Industrial roundwood will be increasingly produced from plantations - 67% in 1990 and 89% by 2010. As expected, fuelwood supply takes the major part of the total wood supply (73%); however, this share will fall to 64% by 2010. Arable lands will contribute to about 84% of the total roundwood production.
